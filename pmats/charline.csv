10,3,Stan,dude we cant go anywhere theyve shut down the airports and the buses
10,3,Cartman,then well ride our big wheels
10,3,Stan,to los angeles
10,3,Cartman,if thats what it takes yes we have to talk to the network the family guy writers arent gonna back down
10,3,Kyle,well good for them they shouldnt the writers are standing up and saying they arent going to be intimidated
10,3,Cartman,intimidated is that what you think this is about kyle
10,3,Kyle,all right dude what the hell has gotten into you i dont trust for one second that your sudden concern for the muslim people is real
10,3,Cartman,all right fine kyle forget the muslim faith for a minute people can get hurt if ten people die because family guy just had to have their little joke will you still think its funny  what if a hundred people died will it be funny then kyle  im going to los angeles im gonna do whatever i can to get that episode pulled before this gets out of hand somebody has to speak for the muslim people somebody has to speak for whats right 
10,3,Kyle,dad are you sure theres time
10,3,Kyle,no
10,3,Kyle,ike iiike  ike 
10,3,Kyle,ike  this way  iiike 
10,3,Kyle,nooooo 
10,3,Cartman,come to try and stop me  it isnt gonna work 
10,3,Kyle,i didnt come to stop you i i think youre right cartman i want to help you get the family guy episode pulled
10,3,Cartman,yeah well i dont need a partner on this  especially one who doesnt trust me 
10,3,Kyle,look cartman i dont know whats gotten into you but i i think its pretty amazing and i think its real you have to understand why i didnt believe you before
10,3,Cartman,yeah i do understand kyle ive been doing the wrong things for a long time doing things for my own selfish reasons i just wanna do something right you know just this one time
10,3,Kyle,its a long trip dude youre gonna need help we can try and get the episode pulled together
10,3,Cartman,you know we might not even make it into the studio
10,3,Kyle,i know but just like you i feel like i have to try people can really get hurt and a joke just isnt worth that
10,3,Cartman,so what made you change your mind
10,3,Kyle,i got some sound advice from an old friend 
10,3,Cartman,well kyle wed better get going
10,3,Kyle,yeah 
10,3,Cartman,are you set
10,3,Kyle,im set lets do this
10,3,Cartman,all right lets roll 
10,3,Randy,well what are we gonna do mayor part 2 of the family guy episode airs in six days
10,3,Randy,i like the sand idea
10,3,Mr. Mackey,yeah me too
10,3,Kyle,we got six days to make it to los angeles if we keep our stops to a minimum we should be able to get the episode pulled just in time
10,3,Cartman,yes and in just a few weeks from now family guy will be off the air forever
10,3,Kyle,off the air but were just going to try to get the mohammad episode pulled
10,3,Cartman,its simple television economics kyle all it takes to kill a show forever is get one episode pulled if we convince the network to pull this episode for the sake of muslims then the catholics can demand a show they dont like get pulled and then people with disabilities can demand another show get pulled and so on and so on until family guy is no more its exactly what happened to laverne  shirley
10,3,Kyle,whoa whoa wait a minute  this isnt what i signed up for i like family guy why do we have to get it off the air forever
10,3,Cartman,because they made ffun of muslims and and thats wrong
10,3,Kyle,but that doesnt mean it has to go off the air you should like that show your sense of humor is just like family guy

10,4,Kyle,thanks kid
10,4,Kyle,sir mister television executive stop
10,4,Kyle,listen to me the little boy who convinced you to pull the episode is a bastard child he only wants you to pull it because he knows it will be the end of family guy forever
10,4,Kyle,pulling an episode because someone is offended starts a chain reaction youll have to pull more and more episodes until the show goes off the air completely its what happened to laverne  shirley
10,4,Kyle,what manatees 
10,4,Cartman,go ahead mr president continue what you were doing
10,4,Kyle,no you have to show mohammad mr president
10,4,Kyle,sir just think about what youre doing to free speech
10,4,Cartman,no think about the people who could get hurt
10,4,Cartman,okay ill make it easy for you  pull the mohammad episode now
10,4,Kyle,noo wait you cant listen to him hes a lying deceitful monster who only wants family guy off the air
10,4,Kyle,you cant do what he wants just because hes the one threatening you with violence
10,4,Cartman,shut up kyle
10,4,Kyle,yes people can get hurt thats how terrorism works but if you give into that doug youre allowing terrorism to work do the right thing here
10,4,Cartman,give the orders to pull the episode mr president
10,4,Kyle,do the right thing mr president
10,4,Kyle,i wish that was good enough but if you censor out mohammad then soon youll have to censor out more
10,4,Cartman,no gay speeches kyle
10,4,Kyle,if you dont show mohammad then youve made a distinction what is okay to poke fun at and what isnt either its all okay or none of it is
10,4,Kyle,do the right thing show mohammad  do the right thing
10,4,Kyle,yes 
10,4,Cartman,no no i hate family guy

10,9,Mr. Mackey,all the girls go out in the hall please i need to speak with the boys of this class mkay  boys we have a very serious problem ive just come from the mens restroom and somebody went number 2 in the urinal 
10,9,Butters,whats a urinal
10,9,Stan,a wall toilet for peeing in
10,9,Mr. Mackey,and some jokester took a poop in it okay now i want whoever did it to come forward right now and it will be less painful for everybody mkay
10,9,Cartman,mr mackey i think you might want to entertain that this is some kind of conspiracy just like 911
10,9,Kyle,oh god here we go again 911 was not a conspiracy fatass
10,9,Cartman,oh really do you just believe everything youre told kyle
10,9,Mr. Mackey,excuse me could we get back to the issue please you all dont seem to understand how serious this is now who made dookie in the urinal  oh you think its funny huh mkay mkay youre gonna think its real funny when the police get here
10,9,Mr. Mackey,but there must have been some motive nobody would just dook in the urinal for no reason
10,9,Stan,did they find out who crapped in the urinal yet
10,9,Kyle,not yet
10,9,Cartman,they arent going to find out who did it but theyll make up a scapegoat send him to detention and make us all believe it itll be 911 all over again
10,9,Kyle,will you shut up about 911
10,9,Cartman,kyle why are you so afraid of the truth
10,9,Kyle,because anybody who thinks 911 was a conspiracy is a retard
10,9,Cartman,oh really well did you know that over onefourth of people in america think that 911 was a conspiracy are you saying that onefourth of americans are retards
10,9,Kyle,yes im saying onefourth of americans are retards
10,9,Stan,yeah at least onefourth
10,9,Kyle,lets take a test sample theres four of us youre a retard thats onefourth
10,9,Cartman,there are soo many people who know the truth kyle uh butters 
10,9,Butters,hey fellas
10,9,Cartman,butters do you think 911 was just a plot by some angry terrorists or do you think there was some kind of coverup
10,9,Butters,well i heard that 911 was caused by president bush
10,9,Cartman,aha do you see
10,9,Kyle,where did you hear that
10,9,Butters,from eric
10,9,Cartman,i rest my case
10,9,Kyle,butters you dont really believe that do you
10,9,Butters,well luh i mean uh you never know uh the government does some pretty spooky things the government and the corporations headed by the jews that tear down 911
10,9,Cartman,thats right butters
10,9,Kyle,goddamnit you see what happens when you spread this stupid crap fatass
10,9,Cartman,what people see the truth
10,9,Butters,can i go now
10,9,Cartman,you guys are blind i cant believe that everyone here is just buying into what theyre told by the media  im gonna go find out the truth im gonna blow the lid off this whooole 911 conspiracy once and for all 
10,9,Kyle,oh no
10,9,Cartman,it is wrong for me to ask questionsis it wrong to seek the truthi just cant blindly accept their versioni cant base my logic on proofalmost all the evidence points one waybut im like charlie sheen and gloria estefani need to know what really happenedon 911levenlevenlevenlevenwhat really happenedon 911of course its so obvious how did we not see it before
10,9,Cartman,uh erh eh uhhh
10,9,Cartman,for show and tell today i have brought  my shocking powerpoint report on the truth  behind the 911 attacks 
10,9,Kyle,oh christ
10,9,Cartman,we are told to believe that the fire from the jet fuel melted the steel framing of the towers  which led to their collapse but did you know jet fuel doesnt burn at a high enough temperature to melt steel  we were told the pentagon was hit by a hijacked plane as well  but now look at this photo of the pentagon the hole is not nearly big enough and if a plane hit it where is the rest of the plane
10,9,Cartman,so now the inevitable question if terrorists didnt cause 911 who did  remember that there are in fact two towers two minus one is one one one  11 two minus one is one one one and there are nine members on silversteins board of directors thats nineoneone nineeleven and take 2  1  911 and you get 12 which leads us all to the mastermind of the 911 attacks  kyle
10,9,Kyle,me
10,9,Cartman,twelve contains the numbers one and two just like the toilet yesterday where somebody went number two instead of number one and one and two with 911 and you get 914 drop the 4 and its 91 exactly the score kyle got on his spelling test twelve days after 911 who has the most to gain from 911 kyle who was nowhere to be found the morning the towers fell kyle who dropped the deuce in the urinal kyle but probably the most damning of all is the evidence seen in this photo of tower 2  when i zoomed in i saw what first appeared to be a blur  but when i computerenhanced it  you almost got away with it you sneaky butthole
10,9,Kyle,hey token  youyou gonna watch the game tonight butters 
10,9,Butters,waaaah 
10,9,Kyle,all right all right i was not responsible for 911  goddamnit
10,9,Kyle,terrible
10,9,Kyle,but everyone thinks i was responsible for 911
10,9,Mr. Mackey,look whatever you believe the fact of the matter is somebody dropped a dookie in the school urinal and theres still no explanation for that
10,9,Mr. Mackey,more important you arent the one who had to walk into the boys bathroom okay after having tuh to wake up early you know theres no no coffee in the teachers lounge and then you you walk into the bathroom just to find a big dook laying there in the urinal like its laughin at you
10,9,Mr. Mackey,no im not saying theyre related
10,9,Randy,how do we know theyre not we need to be brave enough to ask questions 
10,9,Mr. Mackey,oh no not the goddamned
10,9,Randy,godspeed
10,9,Stan,kyle
10,9,Kyle,aaaah
10,9,Stan,dude do you mind telling me why cia guys  are coming to my house and questioning me about you
10,9,Kyle,i dont know dude its like everyones putting pieces together that arent there
10,9,Stan,well why did you have to involve me
10,9,Kyle,its not my fault
10,9,Stan,all right look ive been doing a lot of research on the web and i found an organization who says they can prove you werent involved in 911
10,9,Kyle,really
10,9,Stan,come on well go out the back so they dont see you  theres just one thing i need to know before we go you werent responsible for 911 right
10,9,Kyle,dude
10,9,Stan,thats all i needed 
10,9,Mr. Mackey,now you might all think ive given up finding out who crapped in the urinal mkay and maybe maybe you think its a victimless crime this is mr venezuela  the school janitor okay  hes the person who has to clean up when some trickster drops a dook in the wrong toilet mr venezuela makes six bucks an hour at best okay hes got three kids at home hes got a car that barely works hes gotta clean up puke with sawdust mkay then he walks into the boys room and sees a big meaty chud starin him in the face  so when you crapped in that urinal mkay you might as well have just dropped your pants and laid a turd right on top of mr venezuelas head  oh you think its funny huh
10,9,Mr. Mackey,huh
10,9,Stan,hi we were hoping you can help us my friend is being blamed for 911
10,9,Kyle,they are
10,9,Kyle,what no no no
10,9,Stan,dude why would the government attack its own buildings
10,9,Kyle,thats retarded
10,9,Kyle,theres a lot of holes in the theory of evolution too it doesnt mean its wrong
10,9,Kyle,code 234
10,9,Kyle,what is it
10,9,Kyle,anthrax
10,9,Kyle,stan we cant be seen with this nutjob  aw aw awww
10,9,Mr. Mackey,why clyde why did you do it
10,9,Mr. Mackey,you got a whole school here clyde mkay you got over three hundred people that need to use the boys room  then you decide youre gonna be a comedian mkay and pinch one off in the urinal and leave it layin there for everyone to have to look at  okay okay you think its funny but nobody else does they gotta walk in that bathroom and see your rancid dook propped up against the back of the urinal like a brown rag doll 
10,9,Mr. Mackey,mkay thats good  lets see what your mom and dad have to say about your little poopscapade  come on in please im just trying to get your son to explain why he would drop a dook in the urinal
10,9,Kyle,ehxcuse me theres been a misunderstanding
10,9,Kyle,uh mr president my name is
10,9,Kyle,really
10,9,Stan,jesus christ
10,9,Kyle,no way
10,9,Stan,he was right you did cause 911
10,9,Kyle,really
10,9,Stan,why
10,9,Kyle,really
10,9,Stan,is the whole government in on this
10,9,Stan,kyle run 
10,9,Mr. Mackey,attention students apparently clyde could not have been the one who crapped in the urinal because clyde had a colostomy at age 5 kay now whoever did this unspeakable act is still at large the boys bathroom is closed until further notice cause one of you thought it would be a good idea to pull down your pants mkay hover your buttcheeks over the urinal and squeeze out a chocolate hot dog mkay  oh you think thats funny huh  let me assure you there is nothing funny about going up to a nice clean unsuspectin urinal  kay droppin your pants then turnin around squattin over that urinal kay maybe maybe pullin your buttcheeks apart with your hands mkay and then layin out a big fudge dragon for all the world to see  oh yeah thats real funny  im gonna catch this sonofabitch if its the last thing i do mkay 
10,9,Stan,all right now we have to switch over to interbus 65 we made it dude  we should be home in less than eighteen hours then well tell everyone what we saw
10,9,Kyle,it just doesnt seem right
10,9,Stan,yeah our eyes are finally open dude its like waking up for the first time
10,9,Kyle,yeah but doesnt it seem like we got out of the white house pretty easily i mean it seems like it would be pretty hard to escape from the white house with everyone chasing you and we just kind of ran out 
10,9,Stan,well dude maybe were just super badass have you thought of that 
10,9,Kyle,hey  dude youre alive  come back here 
10,9,Kyle,dude what the hell is going on
10,9,Stan,what who said
10,9,Kyle,dude we arent going to kill you 
10,9,Stan,oh god
10,9,Kyle,who the fuck are you
10,9,Kyle,do you mind telling us what the hell is going on
10,9,Stan,who are you
10,9,Kyle,you ffigured this thing all out

11,1,Randy,two words which by themselves can be harmless but which together form a verbal missile of hate
11,1,Randy,oh sure some people just use the term in jest  tell a nigger guy joke or two thinking its no big deal  but they dont realize it can lead to people using the term as an excuse for violence
11,1,Randy,senators ive learned to admit that im capable of having slightly racist thoughts once in a while can anybody say they never do how long will it be before you are all called nigger guys 
11,1,Randy,we did it

11,2,Kyle,ow quit it dude
11,2,Cartman,ha  for show and tell today i would like to share with you some very special very artsy photographs ive taken in pursuit of being a respected photographer  this first picture i like to call moods of winter  a simple aspen grove shot in highcontrast black and white shows the brittleness of the trunks and reminds one of death this picture i took just as the sun was rising and this lonely man was walking to work a statement about all of our loneliness perhaps
11,2,Kyle,he isnt actually going to show everyone
11,2,Cartman,and now this next picture 
11,2,Butters,bradley please youre my accountabilibuddy how will this make me look
11,2,Butters,youre perfectly normal bradley
11,2,Butters,all right all right that does it  i am sick and tired of everyone telling me im confused i wasnt confused until other people started tellin me i was  you know what i think i think maybe you are the ones who are confused
11,2,Butters,im not gonna be confused anymore just because you say i should be my name is butters im eight years old im blood type o and im bicurious and even thats okay because if im bicurious and im somehow made from god then i think your god must be a little bicurious himself 
11,2,Butters,no i like bein bicurious
11,2,Butters,wait now i am confused
11,2,Cartman,and this photograph i took of a sunset near the power plant note how the contrasting images make a statement about our impact on the earth which brings us to my last picture ahem this picture you may find somewhat controversial 
11,2,Cartman,yes this is shot at a 56 aperture using a lowlight filter you can see the grain from the highspeed film  theres sort of a penis in my mouth right here  and the low depth of field keeps the background soft
11,2,Cartman,what this is is a statement against the war in iraq its wrong that we still have our troops there its wrong and what i think that
11,2,Mr. Mackey,uh eric cartman we got an emergency message from your mother  do not show picture kyle didnt have it after all found it under your desk she said youd know what that means mkay 
11,2,Cartman,lame
11,3,Cartman,ah yes you mean the jew problem  good good im glad were finally gonna do something about it
11,3,Cartman,uh ththat is completely unnecessary everyone knows that only poor people can get lice the only person that can spread it here is kenny
11,3,Kenny,what fuck you
11,3,Butters,boy i sure hope they dont find lice in my hair
11,3,Stan,what do you think happens if you do have it
11,3,Cartman,they drag you out of here put you in this big containment facility where they stick a cold metal pipe up your ass with this clear jelly and then they shock your balls 
11,3,Cartman,this is ridiculous all this just so they can send kenny and his stupid head lice home
11,3,Kenny,hey fuck off 
11,3,Cartman,waiwaiwait whoa whoa so what happened
11,3,Stan,somebody in this class
11,3,Cartman,well who was it  it was kenny right
11,3,Cartman,doesnt matter if somebody had parasites in their hair we need to know who  it was kenny wasnt it
11,3,Cartman,that is bullcrap you are denying our rights as children to totally rip on that kid and make him or her feel like an outcast
11,3,Butters,yeah dumb girls
11,3,Cartman,all right the person who had head lice needs to speak up right now so that we know to stay away from you 
11,3,Cartman,okay whoever you are you are now not only a licehead youre a liar youre only making this worse on yourself
11,3,Kyle,you know what ill bet it was you
11,3,Cartman,me
11,3,Kyle,this is exactly what you would do if they found lice in your hair try to lead the charge against somebody else to take the suspicion off of yourself
11,3,Cartman,i dont think so kyle but you know what this is exactly what you would do if you had had head lice try to get everyone to blame me
11,3,Stan,you guys stop it this isnt getting us anywhere
11,3,Cartman,thats exactly what you would do if you had had head lice stan 
11,3,Kyle,yeah try to have everyone make peace so it doesnt seem like a big deal
11,3,Cartman,and this is exactly what kenny would do stand here and say nothing 
11,3,Butters,heh hey guys what would i do
11,3,Kyle,its too late the treatment would have killed it all
11,3,Cartman,theres a way theres a way to find out who had sickass head cooties and im gonna find it 
11,3,Kyle,it was him it had to have been him
11,3,Stan,yeah or you 
11,3,Cartman,all right lock that door craig 
11,3,Kyle,whats this about cartman 
11,3,Cartman,ive come up with a test that can determine if it was any of us who had the head lice  were gonna find out once and for all who had head cooties  lice feed on a persons blood and just like mosquitoes they leave small traces of their saliva in the hosts bloodstream that saliva is monochromagnic so if an infected persons blood is touched by this hot metal coil say that persons blood will jump 10 meters into the air
11,3,Kyle,thats retarded you didnt come up with that experiment cartman you saw it in that movie the thing
11,3,Cartman,this is a scientific test designed to
11,3,Kyle,you saw it in the thing and youre wasting everyones time
11,3,Cartman,i thought you might say that kyle because you dont want to take the test do you
11,3,Kyle,nobodys blood is going to jump up in the air
11,3,Cartman,if it isnt going to work then what are you afraid of the only person who wouldnt want to take the test is somebody who was worried it might work and reveal that they were the ones with lice
11,3,Kyle,all right fine ill do the dumb test
11,3,Cartman,everyone take a petri dish and a syringe we need at least 30 ccs of blood from each one of you
11,3,Cartman,all right now everyone back over there  well start with what i already know 
11,3,Butters,well guess that proves eric wasnt the one with head lice
11,3,Kyle,it doesnt prove anything
11,3,Cartman,yeah lets just see what your blood does kyle  huh i guess youre clean 
11,3,Cartman,its all right it wont take much longer justahh ahhgh 
11,3,Cartman,kenny
11,3,Kyle,no way
11,3,Cartman,of course i was right i told you only poor people get lice 
11,3,Cartman,he lied to us all he betrayed his kind we all know what has to happen  grab a sock and a bar of soap and meet us at the park 
11,3,Cartman,what clyde
11,3,Cartman,all right see you there  remember bar of soap and a sock kennys gonna get it
11,3,Cartman,kenny mccormick you are charged with bringing head cooties into our school and lying about it to cover your ass how do you plead
11,3,Kenny,not guilty
11,3,Cartman,guilty i thought so 
11,3,Cartman,all right kenny you know what has to happen sock bath everyone wash kenny with the soap and dry him off with the socks 
11,3,Kenny,nohoho no not the socks ahhhgh stop
11,3,Kyle,wait stop it stop it  i cant let kenny be sockdried
11,3,Kyle,kenny didnt have the head lice all right  it was me
11,3,Kyle,i was the one i was too afraid to say anything but i cant let kenny be sockbathed for it
11,3,Stan,why are you saying that kyle you cant be the one who had head lice  because i was youre just trying to make me feel bad because you figured that out didnt you
11,3,Cartman,oh i get it  this is some kind of big trick on me youve known i was the one with head lice all along huh
11,3,Stan,you had head lice
11,3,Cartman,of course why do you think i went through that elaborate bullcrap experiment to frame kenny
11,3,Butters,me too
11,3,Cartman,but that means that means kenny was lying sock bath

11,4,Kyle,all right mapquest the address
11,4,Kyle,good thinking
11,4,Kyle,yeah it just proves we need to learn not to profile one race of people because actually most of the world hates us
11,4,Cartman,well baahir i was thinking that maybe i owe you an apology
11,4,Cartman,yes but then i realized that technically i dont because by being suspicious of you i saved your life and everyone elses so really you owe me an apology but thats cool
11,4,Kyle,you didnt save everyone i did you were just out harassing muslims
11,4,Cartman,but if i hadnt called you in the first place to check out the muslim you would have just stayed in bed sick all day right
11,4,Kyle,maybe 
11,4,Cartman,maybe if i hadnt called you you wouldnt have been on your computer checking out the clinton rally that means my intolerance of muslims saved america
11,4,Kyle,that is so missing the point
11,4,Cartman,me being a bigot stopped a nuclear bomb from going off yes or no
11,4,Kyle,thethats not the right way to look at it i
11,4,Cartman,yes or no kyle
11,4,Kyle,no not not like youre saying
11,4,Cartman,but thats all im saying today bigotry and racism saved the day baahir you get this right 
11,4,Butters,awwwww
11,4,Cartman,okay who got rid of the muslims huh  that was all me simple thank you will suffice
11,5,Randy,in my easter bonnet with all the frills upon it ill be the grandest lady in the easter parade
11,5,Randy,look at that one huh half purple and half yellow with a chikadee sticker im good 
11,5,Stan,uh can i ask a question why do we do this
11,5,Randy,wha what do you mean why do we do this its easter
11,5,Stan,right so why do we color eggs 
11,5,Randy,wulll ssso that the easter bunny can hide them
11,5,Stan,yeah but why
11,5,Randy,stanley easter celebrates the day that jesus was resurrected after being crucified for our sins
11,5,Stan,so we dip eggs in colored vinegar and a giant rabbit hides them
11,5,Randy,thats right
11,5,Stan,you dont see the missteps in logic with that  look im just saying that somewhere between jesus dying on the cross and a giant bunny hiding eggs there seems to be a a gap of information
11,5,Randy,stanley just dye your goddamned eggs
11,5,Stan,i dont feel like coloring eggs i dont get it
11,5,Randy,what is wrong with him
11,5,Sharon,well hes just getting older randy maybe hes figured out the easter bunny isnt real 
11,5,Randy,you know so little 
11,5,Cartman,and i want a baltor soldier doll for easter and five crashngo rc cars you got that do you have that
11,5,Cartman,nono you dont ask me questions you are a rabbit i am a human so if you dont bring me what i want for easter i can fucking kill you
11,5,Cartman,bye easter bunny 
11,5,Stan,all right can you explain to me whats going on
11,5,Stan,what is the deal with the coloring the eggs and you hiding them and all that what does that have to do with jesus dying on the cross  it is symbolic are you trying to reference something that happened in biblical times  answer me
11,5,Stan,i know that but i figure you must have some knowledge of what easters about if youre playing the easter bunny at the mall
11,5,Stan,no im not gonna just go with it im gonna find out whats behind all this 
11,5,Stan,mom dad  anybody home
11,5,Randy,not now stanley im on the toilet 
11,5,Stan,dad youve gotta help me 
11,5,Randy,hang on im taking a crap

11,5,Randy,i wanted to keep this from you stan i really wanted to wait until you were older but you just had to keep asking questions
11,5,Stan,why were those other rabbit guys chasing me
11,5,Randy,we have to be careful when we think somebodys onto us  we are all part of a secret society stan a very ancient very important society of men who follow the way of the rabbit and protect the secret of the easter bunny we are called the hare club for men
11,5,Stan,does mom know about this
11,5,Randy,duh its the hare club for men chicks wouldnt understand
11,5,Stan,i dont understand
11,5,Randy,i belong to a secret society that has been around for thousands of years our identities have to be protected
11,5,Stan,could could you take off the ears please
11,5,Randy,stan you dont seem to understand how serious this is the secret of easter that we protect is something that could rock the foundation of the entire world
11,5,Stan,so what is the secret of easter
11,5,Randy,i cant tell you you have to be allowed into the society first but but perhaps its time
11,5,Randy,i always knew this day would come when my son would be brought into the society reminds me of the day i was brought in by my father
11,5,Stan,grandpas in it too
11,5,Randy,of course marshes have been in the hare club for men for generations all the way back to the beginning
11,5,Stan,dad do i have to wear this bag over my head the entire time
11,5,Randy,you arent a member yet you cant know where our secret meetings take place were going to a distant location an old building near a lake about 40 minutes away

11,12,Cartman,kyle
11,12,Kyle,listen you dont have to do this our imaginations arent running wild anymore
11,12,Kyle,you have to stop
11,12,Kyle,because i  i um because i think they are real its all real think about it havent luke skywalker and santa claus affected your lives more than most real people in this room i mean whether jesus is real or not he hes had a bigger impact on the world than any of us have and the same could be said of bugs bunny and aand superman and harry potter theyve changed my life changed the way i act on the earth doesnt that make them kind of real they might be imaginary but but theyre more important than most of us here and theyre all gonna be around long after were dead so in a way those things are more realer than any of us 
11,12,Cartman,so kyle imaginary things are real huh guess that means i did win the bet after all and you know what that means kyle 
11,12,Kyle,just let it go with your fucking balls you fucking asshole your friends have been in danger and all you care about it this stupid bet well ive decided cartman even if we had a bet that i am never sucking your balls  you got that they can throw me in jail for the rest of my life but i am  never going to suck your balls  never so  there

11,14,Cartman,they cant do that who are they to judge us on how we look
11,14,Stan,yeah you think they rate us just for looks or they take personality into account
11,14,Kyle,you guys who cares if the girls make some stupid list girls make dumb lists all the time
11,14,Cartman,yeah kyles right screw it we have better things to worry about
11,14,Cartman,oh please i dont think so craig chicks think im way hotter than you
11,14,Cartman,no because people know im not fat im buff they probably put you at the bottom of the list because you have fucked up teeth or kenny cause hes poor
11,14,Kenny,they didnt put me at the bottom did they
11,14,Cartman,kenny face it girls dont wanna pop tarts for dinner every night when they get married
11,14,Butters,you dont think they said im the ugliest boy in the class do ya well if they did my parents will ground me

11,14,Cartman,all right bebe lets see the list
11,14,Cartman,you know what im talking about bitch the list where you rate the looks of each boy in the class
11,14,Cartman,craig is on the bottom right or is it kenny cause youd be eating pop tarts for dinner if you married him

11,14,Butters,well i guess were never gonna get that list from the girls
11,14,Cartman,screw that dude were guys we can outthink them
11,14,Cartman,all right heres what we know that chick nelly is the one whos in charge of holding the list right she apparently keeps it in a purple pee chee folder and we need a plan to get it from her  this is what i call operation cannot possibly fail 
11,14,Butters,neato
11,14,Cartman,at 1 pm tomorrow nelly will have to walk from home ec to social studies thats our best time to strike as she makes her way through hallway 3 craig will be ready with a distraction device here  when she stops and turns to craig in the hallway butters will run up and kick her in the balls
11,14,Butters,okay
11,14,Cartman,once butters kicks her in the balls shell fall to the floor dropping the pee chee and kenny will swoop in from corridor 3delta and grab the pee chee are we good
11,14,Cartman,bail bail 
11,14,Cartman,okay our mission failed but weve learned a lot primarily that girls do not have balls
11,14,Butters,they sure dont
11,14,Cartman,never mind because we are going to plan b one that i call operation cannot possibly fail a second time when nelly leaves the cafeteria for recess kenny will jump in front of her and spit on the ground
11,14,Butters,you think maybe girls keep their balls on the inside of their tummies
11,14,Cartman,butters were done talkin about girls balls right now pay attention

12,4,Stan,boy im sure glad thats over with
12,4,Butters,me too
12,4,Kyle,yeah but you know i learned something today we thought we could make money on the internet but while the internet is new and exciting for creative people it hasnt matured as a distribution mechanism to the extent that one should trade real and immediate opportunities for income for the promise of future online revenue it will be a few years before digital distribution of media on the internet can be monetized to the extent that necessitates content producers to forgo their fair value in more traditional media
12,4,Stan,yeah
12,5,Butters,are we gonna get tested on this
12,5,Stan,dude wanna do some math problems
12,5,Mr. Mackey,uh we think its best you not teach until you get your personal life in order mkay

12,5,Cartman,rrrrrrr principal victoria principal

12,5,Cartman,thats mr cartman now kyle and you will be wise not to interrupt my class unless you want to be suspended  yeahhh  mmm yeah you like that  all right clyde youre first get up here  yeah youre gonna take it clyde 
12,5,Cartman,ey dont commend me its the students fault for being so stupid
12,5,Mr. Mackey,uh commend means youve done a great job eric hmkay
12,5,Cartman,oh well thank you i believe strict discipline along with compassion for my students is catamite to their learning
12,5,Cartman,that sounds like a chance to really make an impact on some students who need it most how much will you pay me
12,5,Cartman,three hundred bucks did you hear what i said you guys my awesome teaching skill is gonna earn me three hundred bucks
12,5,Kyle,youre not an awesome teacher
12,5,Cartman,whatever the whole class scored superhigh on the test
12,5,Kyle,the only reason we scored high was because we took the answers out of garrisons desk and you know it
12,5,Cartman,yes but whose idea was it to take the answers out of garrisons desk
12,5,Kyle,kennys
12,5,Kenny,yeah that was my idea
12,5,Cartman,oh yeah but whatever im gonna go teach those underprivileged innercity students and really turns their lives around
12,5,Kyle,do you know what those kids are going to do to you a little middleclass white boy telling them what to do they are going to fucking murder you 
12,5,Cartman,maybe hes right id better be careful how i look
12,5,Cartman,hello students im eric cartmanez  your new teacher
12,5,Cartman,i am here to teach you calculuuus
12,5,Cartman,okay everyone take a sillibus and pass it to the amigo behind youuu
12,5,Cartman,mr cartmanez is here to make sure you all get into collehhhge
12,5,Cartman,how do i reach these keeds  the reason that you think you cant get into college is because you havent been taught how to cheat properly how do you think white people always get ahead because we cheat all the time i mean because they cheat all the time  this is bill beelichick coach of the new england patriots hes won three super bowls how he cheated he even got caught cheating and nobody cared bill beelichick proved that in america its okay to cheat as long as you cheat your way to the top
12,5,Cartman,no no if you cheat and fail youre a cheater if you cheat and succeed youre savvyyy
12,5,Cartman,go ahead the doors right there  byebye have fun we will miss youuu  how do i reach these keeds
12,5,Kyle,what
12,5,Butters,ow that hurt my brains  oww
12,5,Cartman,nice form compadre 
12,5,Cartman,who wants to argue on a nice day like theees how about a little pickup game  hey paisanoo can you keep score for us 
12,5,Cartman,okay you start on defense amigo 
12,5,Cartman,ohoooh thats one to nothing amigo
12,5,Cartman,whats the score ese okay lets go your turn  thats two to nothing amigoo 
12,5,Cartman,look at the scoreboard amigo no matter how many times you say i cheated the scoreboard says two nothing 
12,5,Cartman,two to nothing ese two to nothing  how do i reach these keeds
12,5,Butters,hey wait i think thats teachers penis
12,5,Butters,yeah that must be his
12,5,Butters,huh
12,5,Cartman,today we will discuss one of the fundamental ways to cheat getting material ahead of time  when bill beelichick cheated for the patriots what did he do he videotaped the opposing teams defense think of the defense as your test when taking a test you must also videotape the defense learn whats on the test before they give it to you and that way you can 
12,5,Cartman,have a seat amigo good to have you baaack  all right now when bill beelichick got caught with his camera he did not panic he simply said what every good white cheater says when caught i misinterpreted the rules its what you must also say when caught cheating i misinterpreted the rules say it with me
12,5,Cartman,good again
12,5,Cartman,again
12,5,Cartman,now you sound like white people
12,5,Cartman,the answer to 27 is 5
12,5,Cartman,the answer to 28 is 14
12,5,Cartman,all right uh everyone review the section on sportscasters forgiving the patriots for cheating and saying it was no big deal ill be right back  melita melita hold on  you cant quit now come on whats wrong with you
12,5,Cartman,how do i reach these keeds  all right lets go get you an abortion
12,5,Cartman,abortion isnt wrong whats the one thing ive been teaching you
12,5,Cartman,yes and abortion is the ultimate form of cheating youre cheating nature itself  why do rich white girls get ahead in life because they get abortionnns when theyre young they get pregnant but they still want to go to college so whatever they just cheat they cheat that little critter in their belly right out of a chance at life
12,5,Cartman,mexicans are told not to cheat dont cheat you got pregnant you have to raise the child so then you have to raise the child while the white girls get to go to college and probably have a bunch more abortionnns  it is at our most challenging times that we must cheat our very hardest
12,5,Chef,whatsa that peenis doing ina myii kitchen 
12,5,Cartman,uh what
12,5,Cartman,ih its not for nothing ih if youre good enough you can cheat right in front of them
12,5,Cartman,how do i reeeach these keeeeds  just before the last super bowl bill beelichick gathered his football players and said lets win this one for real just this one time lets not cheat you know what happened  they lost  even if you feel all eyes are upon you you cannot give up on cheating or else you can lose the biggest game of your lives
12,5,Cartman,you are the true dreamers tomorrow you will prove it we will begin by reviewing how to print out cheat sheets as labels for your bottled water
12,5,Cartman,i reeached these keeeds
12,5,Mr. Garrison,thanks everyone its great to be back im a man again thanks to my very special new friend  but you know ive learned that ive really been a dude all along because the key difference between men and women is that women can have babies if you cant have babies then youre a man
12,5,Mr. Garrison,well then get an aids test thompson cause your wifes a dude faggot  yeah im back

12,6,Randy,and so what have we learned through this ordeal the internet went away it came back but for how long we do not know we cannot take the internet for granted any longer we as a country must stop overlogging on we must use the internet only when we need it its easy for us to think we can just use up all the internet we want but if we dont treat the internet with the respect  that it deserves it could one day be gone forever so let us learn to live with the internet not for it no more browsing for no apparent reason no more mindlessly surfing on our laptops while watching television and finally  we must learn to only use the internet for porn twice a day max

13,1,Kenny,woohoo 
13,1,Cartman,i told him a womans mouth is the most germridden place on earth i said statistically the most unsafe place for a man to put his penis i said
13,1,Kyle,well now we know
13,1,Cartman,and knowing is half the battle
13,2,Cartman,the city isnt what it used to be it all happened so fast everything went to crap its like everyones sense of morals just disappeared bad economy made things worse  the jobs started drying up then the stores had to shut down  then a black man was elected president he was supposed to change things  he didnt  as more and more people turned to crime and violence the town becomes gripped in fear dark times the city needs protection  there is an animal that lives by night searches the trashcans and cleans out the garbage  to clean out the trashcan of society ive chosen to become more than a man  im the hero this town needs i am  the coon  as the world plummets into despair the coon fights to keep order intact 
13,2,Cartman,hey guys good morning  you guys hear that another rape victim got saved by a superhero last night they say it was the coon
13,2,Stan,whos the coon
13,2,Cartman,i know right  who is the coon its what everyone must be asking themselves somebody is dressing up at night and taking the law into their own hands as for me i certainly dont agree with the coons reckless ways if you ask me theres no room in this world for vigilantes i believe the coon is a menace
13,2,Kyle,yeah and dressing up and running around at night is faggy anyway
13,2,Cartman,youre a fag kyle fuck you
13,2,Kyle,dude what
13,2,Cartman,hes not a fag
13,2,Kyle,why do you care
13,2,Cartman,oh i uh well i ah ah  im just im just mad cause you should never use the term fag kyle thats a hate word and its insensitive to butt pirates anyway what do you think about the coon stan and kenny do you think hes the savior this town needs or do you think hes a dangerous vigilante  kenny
13,2,Cartman,and of course the most common question asked is just who is he  is he a hero or a menace  while we can all admit that the coon is obviously really cool we should also be asking each other why does he care so much for the people of this town why does he sacrifice himself every night to rid our streets of crime and does he really have the right what we all need now  clyde clyde could you wake up please this is important  what we all need now is proof that the coon exists i believe that tonight from approximately 5 to 545 the coon is going to be on the roof of walgreens i know ill be there with my camera and im sure many of you will too
13,2,Cartman,which one of them is it somebody is dressing up and pretending to be a superhero but who has to be one of the guys in my class cause only they knew that the coon would be on the rooftop of walgreens  no stop cant think about that right now have to focus  tomorrow is the most important day in the coons life everything the coon has lived and fought for comes down to tomorrow concentrate
13,2,Cartman,hunh
13,2,Cartman,i got boned thats what i did mom i try to do good stuff and nobody even notices

13,3,Butters,hi grandma
13,3,Sharon,all right everyone eat up 
13,3,Randy,aw jesus christ sliced hot dogs and tomato slices
13,3,Sharon,you said we had to be very careful with our money ive got nothing for our food budget
13,3,Stan,mom dad how come theres suddenly no money
13,3,Randy,ill tell you what happened son see theres a bunch o idiots out there who werent happy with what they had  they wanted a bigger house and materialistic things that they didnt even need  people with no money who got loans to buy frivolous things they had no business buying  and these assholes just blindly started buying any stupid thing that looked appealing  cause they thought money was endless  it goes back to when the government had the idea that everyone in america deserves to own a house so we have people having a hard time paying their loans  meaning less money coming in  and the idiots couldnt see that by doing all this frivolous spending they were mocking the economy and they made the economy very angry  were all feeling the economys vengeance because of materialistic heathens who did stupid things with their money do you understand son 
13,3,Stan,yeah i think i get it
13,3,Cartman,and where has all the money gone it must have gone somewhere the answer is obvious my friends it is the jews covetous jews who have taken all our money and hoarded it for themselves hidden all the cash in some secret jew cave that they built probably back in the early 60s it is the jews my friends who are oft
13,3,Randy,there are different people casting all different kinds of blame from person to person but the fault lies in all of you  you who bought that three hundred thousand house when you only had twenty thousand to put down you who bought that third car even though only two people in your home drive it is time to stop pointing fingers  finger pointing gets us nowhere steve we have mocked our economy and now the economy has cast its vengeance upon us all
13,3,Randy,yea it is an angry and unforgiving economy to repent we must stop frivolous spending instead of paying for cable let us watch clouds instead of buying clothes wear but sheets from thine beds cut spending to only the bare essentials water and bread and margaritas yea 
13,3,Stan,yeah i wanna return this margaritaville my stupid dad bought
13,3,Stan,what
13,3,Stan,so
13,3,Stan,well cant i just return it and get the money my dad put in back
13,3,Randy,we have become lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of the economy there are those who will say that the economy has forsaken us nay you have forsaken the economy and now you know the economys wrath o thoust can shop at a sporting goods store but knowest thou that the economy will take away thy broncos cap from thine head  mock the economy without fear thine own stockbrokers now lie dead by their own hand and thou knowest that thy stockbrokers did not fear the economy well here we are my friends you have brought the economys vengeance upon yourselves
13,3,Randy,we must all wear sheets instead of buying clothes that need detergent instead of cars that take gasoline we can get around on llamas from drakes farm instead of video games that take batteries and software our kids will play with squirrels we must let the economy know that we are capable of respecting it no more needless spending  the economy is our shepherd we shall not want 
13,3,Kyle,well this sucks
13,3,Cartman,hengh  of all the times for people to decide to stop buying things it had to be the week that grand theft auto 4 comes out for nintendo ds  hengh
13,3,Kyle,you want something new every week fatass
13,3,Cartman,dont you fraternize me this is all your fault you know
13,3,Kyle,my fault
13,3,Cartman,the jews took all the money away and they ha
13,3,Kyle,dont even start dont even start cartman
13,3,Butters,well  why are we wearin bedsheets and playing with squirrels kyle
13,3,Kyle,not because of the jews butters who told you that
13,3,Butters,well eric did 
13,3,Cartman,just tell us where the cave is kyle
13,3,Kyle,now look the reason were in this situation is because people are being stupid the economy isnt some vengeful being that takes things away from us the economy is just made up of people and people have just lost their faith in it  what people really should be doing is spending more spending is fine people should just go outside people should just go outside they should buy the things they need for their friends and family
13,3,Stan,i wanna return this margaritaville
13,3,Stan,no thanks i wanna return this margaritaville and the guy at sur la table said that you were the company that financed it
13,3,Stan,what
13,3,Stan,wall street
13,3,Stan,so
13,3,Randy,i am pretty smart yea but i have assembled this economic committee to make sure that everyone sticks to my new plan
13,3,Randy,then perhaps soon our economy will return to us
13,3,Randy,what
13,3,Randy,relax father maxi what harm can one jew do against our economic recovery movement
13,3,Cartman,i had a dream last night i was in a field and i had grand theft auto chinatown wars right next to me but then the sky went black and grand theft auto chinatown wars just melted in my hand

13,3,Stan,what
13,3,Stan,aargh 
13,3,Kyle,listen this is all you need to know the economy is not a supernatural allknowing entity the economy is just an idea made up by people thousands of years ago the economy is not real and yet it is real nowadays theyll give credit to practically anyone who applies for them  i applied for this yesterday to prove a point it is an american express platinum card  it has no spending limit  do not be afraid this is only plastic its just something made up by people truly meaningless until we put our faith in it faith is what makes an economy exist without faith it is only plastic cards and paper money
13,3,Randy,weve done everything we can and yet the economy has not improved worse it has declined poor bart here just lost his job at little caesars pizza our tireless work is obviously being undermined by this one jew why does he go around pretending to know the true will of the economy
13,3,Randy,that is stupid yea and going around telling people to shop is dangerous
13,3,Cartman,did somebody say catch a jew the person youre after might be hard to get but i can bring him to you and all i want in return is grand theft auto chinatown wars for handheld nintendo ds
13,3,Stan,i want to return this margaritaville my dad bought it on a payment plan set up by a finance company that got investors from wall street who combined it into securities sold to the banks who transferred it to you

13,5,Kyle,let me guess you wrote the joke and cartman just laid on the couch eating twizzlers
13,5,Kyle,i knew it dont let that fat turd walk all over you jimmy stand up for yourself
13,5,Kyle,what
13,5,Kyle,craig if cartman didnt do anything then he doesnt deserve any of the credit
13,5,Kyle,no dude screw that jimmy if cartman didnt write the joke then definitely dont sign any patent papers with him just say cartman you didnt have anything to do with this joke and you know it
13,5,Cartman,motherfucker
13,5,Cartman,jimmy dude did you see carlos mencia is taking credit for our joke
13,5,Cartman,yeah dude i told you this would happen now look i got a lawyer to draw up some patent papers weve got to sign these so that people know that the joke belongs to you and me
13,5,Cartman,but jimmy some fat turd is taking credit for something he didnt do
13,5,Cartman,what
13,5,Cartman,jimmy thats messed up we decided that day to write together dont you remember
13,5,Cartman,hey jimmy wanna hang out
13,5,Cartman,team up okay lets write some jokes together
13,5,Cartman,do we like fishsticks what does she think we are gay fish  uh oh look out jimmy its a black widow 
13,5,Cartman,look exactly who came up with which part of the joke isnt even relevant we had an agreement jimmy and if you wanna go back on that now well then youre no better than a jew
13,5,Cartman,its cool man its cool 
13,5,Cartman,hey kyle can i talk to you for a second
13,5,Kyle,dude get out of here im peeing
13,5,Cartman,its just i dont know what to do about jimmy im starting to think he might try and jew me out of my half of the fishsticks joke  i just need you to teach me some jew defensive moves kyle because we really both did come up with it 
13,5,Kyle,you know what cartman i believe you
13,5,Cartman,you do
13,5,Kyle,yes i believe that you believe you helped write that joke thats how people like you work your ego is so out of whack that it will do whatever it can to protect itself and people with a messed up ego can do these mental gymnastics to convince themselves theyre awesome when really theyre just douchebags 
13,5,Cartman,but im sure i helped come up with the joke didnt i
13,5,Cartman,hey jimmy whats up dawg
13,5,Cartman,thats cool you wanna write some together 
13,5,Cartman,cool thanks lets get to work now lets see something thats a play on words i dont know fishsticks you know cause it cause dicks
13,5,Cartman,oh thank you mrs valmer  now lets see the setup could be do you like fishsticks
13,5,Cartman,so then i can say what are you a gay fish
13,5,Cartman,its a dragon of some kind dont worry i can save you all 
13,5,Butters,hey look eric killed a dragon
13,5,Cartman,thanks you guys
13,5,Cartman,nnnope no i definitely helped write the joke all i can hope is jimmy doesnt try and jew me over
13,5,Cartman,hi ellen  do you guys like fishsticks  thank you thank you no really thank you
13,5,Cartman,ellen comedy is like a game of racquetball you know you serve and the other person hits it back it bounces off the wall you backhand it and it goes back and forth and back and forth and then hopefully youve got a good joke thank you
13,5,Cartman,truth of the matter is that there has never really been a team like us before i mean lets be perfectly honest a lot of people wouldnt work with someone whos disabled but i see past that i look beyond jimmys disabilities and find a bond which can unite us in comedy working with crippled people is really important 
13,5,Cartman,ahaw dont cry pal youre gonna get me started anyway what was really important for us as a team ellen was to make sure that everyone knew that we came up with the joke and not carlos butthole mencia
13,5,Cartman,uhhh excuse me 
13,5,Cartman,alright so check it out weve got offers from van de kamps and gortons fisherman to do commercials
13,5,Cartman,yeah that was kewl huh
13,5,Cartman,whassat
13,5,Cartman,so here it is
13,5,Cartman,that is bullcrap jimmy and you know it i had just as much to do with the fishsticks joke as you did  dude its puff daddy
13,5,Cartman,oh so now its we huh jimmy a minute ago you said you did it all yourself
13,5,Cartman,abebeh abebebebebeah we both came up with it together you wanna know how it happened
13,5,Cartman,hello jim
13,5,Cartman,what are you up to
13,5,Cartman,well maybe i can help you we can team up 
13,5,Cartman,now lets see how about a joke that has something to do with fishsticks you know cause fishsticks sounds like fish dicks jimmy
13,5,Cartman,thanks  so what im thinking is do you like fishsticks in your mouth 
13,5,Butters,eric eric you have to save us an entire army of jew robots 
13,5,Cartman,oh my god what are jewbots doing here  flame on  flame off 
13,5,Cartman,come on jimmy we gotta go back and finish that joke  like fishsticks in your mouth what are you a gay fish there 
13,5,Cartman,aw dammit i guess it really was all me who came up with it
13,5,Cartman,youve gotta let jimmy go its all my fault
13,5,Cartman,jimmy you really believe that you came up with it all on your own oh my god wait i totally get it now
13,5,Cartman,all this time ive been mad at you jimmy for trying to take all the credit but now i realize its just that your ego has made you believe things happened differently thats what kyle was trying to tell me that you have such a huge ego you do these mental gymnastics to make yourself a part of things
13,5,Cartman,i thought you were just trying to jew me out of my part of the credit but now i realize that some people just have egos that are so out of whack that no matter what people tell them they cant accept the truth of who they are  jimmy i owe you an apology i realize now you cant help believing you created the entire joke because your ego wont let you think otherwise i just have to accept that

13,8,Kyle,your mom uses chipotlaway to clean blood stains out of your underwear

13,8,Kyle,and then takes you to chipotle and buys you more
13,8,Cartman,yes kyle its totally normal  people do this stuff you know not everyone can be the boy with the golden butthole 
13,8,Stan,here here here it is possession by a ghost a ghost that enters and then refuses to leave a living host has done so because it failed in the living world to be what it wanted to be the ghost must be allowed to transform and be recognized by the living as what it always tried to be
13,8,Kyle,what has michael jackson always tried to be
13,8,Cartman,a child and a female and white
13,8,Stan,so he wants to finally be accepted by the living as a little white girl
13,8,Kyle,well what the hell are we gonna do dress him up in a princess gown and and parade him around like the parents on those awful child pageants 
13,8,Kyle,go on by michael

13,9,Butters,hey fellers fellers do you like gettin kisses cause i know a girl thatll give you a great kiss for just five dollars
13,9,Butters,sure scott even if you got diabetes
13,9,Butters,boy oh boy this sure is great ive been thinkin sally i could probably drum up some third grade customers if you could do kisses before school too we could make double the money
13,9,Butters,aww nuts  well i did have another idea what if we got another girl to fill in for you sometimes
13,9,Butters,well you know we bring someone on show her what to do and then share all our money together
13,9,Butters,we could have our very own  kissin company
13,9,Butters,the next key to a successful business is innovation i think maybe we need to understand that some boys simply cant afford the five dollars for a kiss so what if we start also charging just two dollars for a hug
13,9,Butters,why thanks sally i think your position behind the temp building at recess is perfect megan im thinkin about moving you to the baseball field after school during little league practice
13,9,Butters,i got a kissing booth set up at the kids fair on saturday so kayla and ashley you take turns there any girl that sells more than twenty kisses gets  a little sunshine but if you dont show up for work at all im afraid you get a stormy cloud

13,10,Cartman,well the way we see it we have three primary obstacles in making smackdown a great show token butters jimmy
13,10,Kenny,yep
13,10,Kyle,what are you talking about
13,10,Cartman,guys lets face it they cant wrestle for crap i mean every time i wrestle with one of them they flub a line or blow their monologue and token he has no emotion no timing hes the worst wrestler ive ever seen
13,10,Stan,hes right

13,10,Stan,dude its really hard to do your best wrestling when youre up against token
13,10,Cartman,right
13,10,Stan,and butters and jimmy i mean theyre okay but theyre never gonna make it as professional wrestlers
13,10,Kyle,well so then wwe will recruit us and not them
13,10,Cartman,no dude theyre gonna hurt our chances
13,10,Kenny,theyre gonna hurt our chances
13,10,Cartman,because we all know that the new material ive written is stuff those guys cant handle and well suffer from it
13,10,Kyle,so what do we do
13,10,Kenny,weve gotta bring somebody else on
13,10,Cartman,yep weve gotta bring somebody else on who can handle the more difficult roles that we can wrestle against instead of those guys
13,10,Stan,somebody who can do the harder stuff weve written so that token butters and jimmy can have smaller parts
13,10,Kyle,how do we find somebody who can wrestle that well
13,10,Cartman,its simple we just gotta hold tryouts
13,10,Cartman,number seventeen step forward please  youre wrestling a muslim immigrant you suspect he could be a terrorist and your parrents died in the 911 attacks go

13,12,Stan,yes now get out of here
13,12,Butters,okay 
13,12,Stan,alright kyle and i are gonna spray paint messages to the harley riders cartman you said you had an idea
13,12,Cartman,i think what im gonna do is uh find out wherever their bikes are and uh crap on their seats
13,12,Stan,oh thats good
13,12,Cartman,yeah i think thatll be nice
13,12,Stan,but thats a lot of seats how are you going to pull that off
13,12,Cartman,i think i just need uh two maybe three buckets of kfc extra crispy probably four cartons of gravy
13,12,Stan,clyde can you take care of getting kfc for cartman kyle and i will get the spray paint cans if we do this right well be doing the town a huge favor so lets get to it
13,12,Stan,really nice work guys
13,12,Kyle,yeah i think maybe everything is gonna be okay now
13,12,Cartman,that was us
13,12,Stan,yeah we did that
13,12,Kyle,wwell cause we want all of those fags to get out of town
13,12,Cartman,yeah everyone hates those fags right
13,12,Mr. Mackey,now just what the heck is going on here this is not what we have taught you in this school kyle and stan youve always been tolerant of gay people
13,12,Stan,gay people
13,12,Kyle,we arent talking about gay people
13,12,Mr. Mackey,you just admitted to spraypainting that they should get out of town
13,12,Stan,dude why would we want gay people to get out of town
13,12,Cartman,oh they think we meant gay fags
13,12,Kyle,oh hey thats not very nice mayor just because a person is gay doesnt mean hes a fag
13,12,Stan,aw crap
13,12,Kyle,because were not referring to gay people you can be gay and not be a fag
13,12,Stan,yeah a lot of fags arent gay
13,12,Stan,do you ride a big loud harley and go up and down the streets ruining everyones nice time
13,12,Stan,then youre not a fag
13,12,Cartman,then hes a gay fag i mean is this really this hard
13,12,Stan,i dont know
13,12,Kenny,this is fucking ridiculous
13,12,Stan,all right look youre driving in your car okay and youre waiting to make a left at a traffic signal the light turns yellow should be your turn to go but the traffic coming at you just keeps coming and even when the light turns red a guy in a bmw runs the red light so you cant make your left turn what goes through your mind
13,12,Stan,right but youre not thinkin oh hes a homosexual youre thinkin oh hes an inconsiderate douchebag like a harley rider
13,12,Cartman,you call them bikecurious
13,12,Stan,bikecurious dont you people keep up with todays lingo at all
13,12,Kenny,jesus fucking christ
13,12,Randy,fags

13,12,Stan,aw crap 
13,12,Kyle,were sorry mayor
13,12,Stan,we can fix this
13,12,Stan,that that lady said its because fag still means homosexual in the dictionary so we just have to convince the dictionary people to change the definition
13,12,Cartman,hey hey yeah then people would be free to call harley riders fags all over the country
13,12,Cartman,emmanuel lewis huh
13,12,Stan,ohh it all makes sense now 
13,12,Randy,look out its a bunch of pissedoff faggots 
13,12,Stan,theres fags everywhere
13,12,Kyle,we gotta run 
13,12,Stan,yes yes sir you are total fags 
13,12,Kyle,yeah you definitely made your point
13,12,Stan,yeah yeah thats totally what a fag does
13,12,Stan,but then why are you acting like such fags i dont understand
13,12,Kyle,i dont either
13,12,Butters,thats because you guys never understood  you fellers never got what these people are really about freedom rebellion against the system a living image of independence solid defiant and supremely cool the biker is an allamerican icon of resilient individuality and freedom
13,12,Butters,im not a fag yet sirruh but a but i am bikeccurious
13,12,Cartman,no thatll just make you bigger fags
13,12,Stan,and that mister editor is why they are the true definition of fags
13,12,Stan,we did it yeah
13,12,Kyle,yeah we did it you guys 
13,12,Cartman,oh its over its finally over 
13,12,Stan,today weve made history
13,13,Mr. Mackey,we will always remember the way that gordon bravely read the announcements every morning led us in the pledge of allegiance mkay and touched many kids lives here at the school and even now that we know the shooter had him confused with a fortyyearold truck driver who happened to have a similar name i know this has been pretty traumatizing mkay but now we must decide who will pick up up where little gordon left off who will take his place reading the morning announcements its a big responsibility because it will be your voice the entire school listens to mkay and although gordon stoltski can never be replaced mkay there must be a student out there who has the drive and the passion to have his or her voice heard every morning
13,13,Cartman,oh my goodddd
13,13,Cartman,soo youre uuh trying out to be the morning announcement person as well
13,13,Mr. Mackey,oh this is it huh okay uhhh mike why dont we have you try out first ituh mkay 
13,13,Cartman,he stuttered like a bitch ive got this job in the bag  who are you
13,13,Mr. Mackey,mkay really nice mike uh maybe next time you can get past the first word oh casey miller good youre trying out too
13,13,Mr. Mackey,mkay eric you wanna go next 
13,13,Mr. Mackey,mkay eric im just gonna have you read this piece of paper
13,13,Cartman,mr mackey what is a moronic jizzrag
13,13,Mr. Mackey,what what on earth are you askin me that for
13,13,Cartman,well its just that thats what that casey kid said about your hairpiece
13,13,Mr. Mackey,get lost you little dirtball
13,13,Mr. Mackey,i said take a hike
13,13,Mr. Mackey,beat it youre not gettin the job 
13,13,Cartman,good morning south park elementary these are the morning announcements and i am eric cartman all forms for the school book drive must be handed it to mr davis in the library by the end of the school day today hm doesnt seem like they gave us a lot of notice on that uh kay oh well  for lunch today the cafeteria will be serving a selection of cold sandwiches cold sandwiches oh well thank you so much remember when we used to be served hot food i mean what has happened to our school this school is transforming into something very bad and why because we have leadership that doesnt care im talking of course about our student body president wendy testaburger  ever since wendy was elected student body president this school has started a rapid decline towards some socialist regime where students no longer have a voice the music room will be closed off today due to painting all students in band and choir will meet in the gymnasium instead oh oh so now so now the school is using money to paint the music room how old and outdated is our playground equipment what other school has a fifteenyearold merrygoround on it our school president is turning this whole place into communist russia  its not a coincidence that once wendy took office this school started coming apart at the seams your teachers dont wanna tell you but they are scared and they should be because the very fabric of this elementary school is tearing from all corners
13,13,Butters,oh jeez
13,13,Cartman,but hey im just a normal kid like you except that i ask questions and because im brave enough to ask questions i come under scrutinies is wendy using your lunch money to buy heroin probably not but how can we know i dont want my lunch money going to drugs whos taking these drugs what would be the point im asking questions
13,13,Kyle,will somebody shut him up
13,13,Cartman,you wanted to see me principal victoria
13,13,Cartman,oohhhh i get it youre trying to silence me youre scared that somebody is standing up to this school and its president for once
13,13,Cartman,oh really then how come gordon stoltski got to go on for like five minutes that one day
13,13,Mr. Mackey,well because he was being murdered
13,13,Cartman,you just want somebody to read whats in front of them like a brainwashed zombie is that it mr mackey i am not gordon stoltski okay im not some dog on a leash that just blindly says what hes told until hes killed
13,13,Cartman,oh i will and maybe ill also have a word with the aclu tell them that a student is being told not to speak out against his school im sure theyll find that very interesting
13,13,Cartman,well goood morning south park elementary these are the morning announcements tryouts for the soccer team are on friday afternoon that is of course if our student body president does something about our abysmal soccer field  i have a question what does wendy testaburger actually do she is supposed to be the president right what is her agenda shes lying to everyone or is she lets ask these questions  today i wanna talk briefly about the state of our schools economy the bake sale last week was a complete failure and in the school  and besides that who actually voted for wendy testaburger i know i didnt and everyone who did is now scratching their heads and goin whoops guess i shouldnt have done that  im not in the student council im just a normal kid like all of you and like all of you i want to know what has happened to my school
13,13,Cartman, of the united states of america our united states not the one wendy testaburger would have a socialist dunghole 
13,13,Cartman,good morning students these are the morning announcements if youll direct your attention to the new video monitors at the head of your class  you will see that the announcements are now being done in video
13,13,Kyle,oh god no 
13,13,Cartman,lunch today is going to be pizza again  friends our school is dying and you know it you feel it youre like youre like me you wanna change it but ohhh no wendy testaburgers not gonna let that happen this is not the school we grew up in and and i dont know if we can get it back  so lets take a look at exactly what our school president wants you know what is she trying to achieve lets just take a look at these keywords here wendys made it clear she wants our school to be a more integrated leftist and liberal place but you see what then happens what we get is a socialist modern utopian reformed farce of a school so when you look closely it becomes very obvious what wendy wants k i l l s m u r f s our school president wants to kill smurfs
13,13,Cartman,i dont know if were turning into a smurfhating school or what were turning into but unless you ask why  were gonna transform into something
13,13,Butters,hey wendy wendy is it true
13,13,Butters,that you hate smurfs
13,13,Butters,hey now me and us fellers were just asking questions
13,13,Butters,it is true
13,13,Butters,what did the smurfs ever do to you ya bitch i just called the president a bitch
13,13,Cartman,thank you and this is to
13,13,Cartman,to douglas there you go  book signing today everyone be sure to pick up your copy
13,13,Butters,hey eric
13,13,Cartman,well hello another person who  cares about the future of our school
13,13,Butters,oh you bet i love all the stuff you said about how our school president never does anything and how shes changing everything
13,13,Cartman,yes well now you can read about all those things ive said butters take this copy of my book
13,13,Butters,cool thanks
13,13,Cartman,thatll be five dollars
13,13,Butters,oh okay 
13,13,Stan,what the hell do you think youre doing
13,13,Cartman,a book signing
13,13,Stan,i looked through your stupid book its five hundred and forty pages of ripping on wendy and calling her a slut
13,13,Cartman,i do not directly say shes a slut
13,13,Stan,wendy testaburger has proven time and time again that she will do anything to pleasure her vagina whether it is the school football team or the janitors on their break wendy spends her time as president on her knees or on her back taking the old inout for hours on end
13,13,Cartman,you didnt read the rest dude
13,13,Stan,or does she
13,13,Cartman,or does she see thats a question im asking questions stan ive called for wendy to come on my show and defend herself but she wont do it
13,13,Butters,yeah and she hates smurfs
13,13,Stan,hey hey stop reading that
13,13,Stan,listen just because a guys voice is on the intercom and his words are in a book doesnt mean he has any idea what hes talking about
13,13,Stan,wendy did you see the stuff cartman is saying about you now
13,13,Stan,well dont you think you should go on his show and defend yourself everyone is starting to think youre a crappy president
13,13,Cartman,you wanted to see me again principal victoria
13,13,Cartman,oh wendy came and told on me so what because shes president she cant be written about
13,13,Mr. Mackey,eric apparently you wrote that wendys private parts are big enough to fly an airplane through mkay
13,13,Cartman,and what if they are youll stop me from asking just because wendy forces you to
13,13,Mr. Mackey,eric the student body president really doesnt have the kind of power that you
13,13,Cartman,just enough power to force you to stop me from selling my book face it youre a lackey mackey
13,13,Cartman,clear as summer rain clear as a flavorless bottle of vitamin water this school has finally transformed to the socialist whoreland where a student isnt free well im not gonna be a part of it do you understand im leaving this hypocritical communist school im walking out and im never coming back 
13,13,Cartman,yesterday as most of you know i walked out on this program and on our school i was so fed up with our presidents hypocrisies me not being able to sell my book i wanted to live in a place where my values were still upheld and so i decided to leave it all behind and instead just go and live with the smurfs  i simply observed the gentle smurfs at first i wanted to understand how they could live such simple and decent lives they were wary of me in the beginning but slowly i began to earn their trust  it wasnt long before the gentle smurfs accepted me as one of their own 
13,13,Butters,whoa 
13,13,Cartman,the smurfs and i grew to understand each other  they shared with me their art of picking smurfberries and i shared with them stories of my countrys forefathers of course it wasnt long before i fell in love with smurfette  were from two different worlds and yet we spoke the common language of passion
13,13,Kyle,these are the morning announcements 
13,13,Cartman,papa smurf was displeased at first  he told smurfette i wasnt a real smurf and we could never be happy but i eventually proved myself to papa smurf by picking more smurfberries than any smurf had ever smurfed before finally all was right with the world but then a crisis clumsy smurf burst into the smurf ceremony to say that humans had come to destroy all of smurfland
13,13,Cartman,and so now our school has plenty of precious unattainable smurfberries yeah well big deal at what cost did our school president get it every smurf is dead wiped out and we will never see them again go on look outside you wont see any smurfs  of course since im being silenced im not allowed time to show you the entire movie and so please buy dances with smurfs available now on dvd  the question now is what happened to morals what happened to dignity what happened to my schooool
13,13,Butters,that does it our student council is corrupt and has to be dealt with
13,13,Butters,we need to get all the kids together who wanna fight back and tell them to meet after school we will forever remember this day the day we finally stood up to wendy testaburger
13,13,Butters,i dont know about all of you but i have had enough weve been sitting back and watching as our school slowly goes into the toilet but today we do something about it  so lets march right over there to wendys house and do what we know needs to be done 
13,13,Butters,let us not forget what happens this day
13,13,Butters,we are here wendy testaburger

15,4,Kyle,thirteen point seven inches
15,4,Cartman,yeah its pretty good
15,4,Kyle,your wiener is not 13 inches long
15,4,Stan,you made everyone else get measured with witnesses you have to too

15,4,Cartman,there you see my wiener isnt 12 inches its 14  what red youre all freaking out because my wiener is smaller than the other guys i dont care  clearly im very happy with the size of my wiener or else why would i have called for a new measurement and for this poster to be put up at all dont forget that this was all my idea
15,4,Cartman,oh goddamnit
15,4,Cartman,let me guess im in trouble again
15,4,Cartman,for what
15,4,Cartman,why did you measure our penis sizes and put the results on the school bulletin board
15,4,Cartman,i dont care if obama is president you dont go around putting little boys on blast telling the whole world the length of their dicks
15,4,Cartman,youre damn right one point two inches ill have you know that my penis is a respectable 14 inches maybe its still the smallest in school but its 2 inches bogger than you said
15,4,Cartman,what
15,4,Cartman,those werent our dick sizes
15,4,Cartman,i dont know why would you
15,4,Cartman,aw crap you mean everyone knows my wiener is smaller than everyone elses because of me
15,4,Cartman,oh god why couldnt i have just taken a minute to think about it
15,4,Cartman,fuck you no i dont
15,4,Cartman,honestly i wouldnt really care
15,4,Cartman,im not fat im bigboned
15,4,Randy,oh dear
15,4,Randy,did they measure from the base or from the balls 
15,4,Randy,im a scientist i think its best i handle this
15,4,Randy,hello students my name is dr marsh and im gonna talk to you a little bit about what happened at the school yesterday how do a man and a woman make a baby anybody a man and woman what do they do to make a baby how about the little girl in the brown coat yeah you
15,4,Randy,good the man puts his penis  okay into the womans vagina  okay now sometimes a man can feel like how long his penis is is actually important but is it when you boys measure your penis length the truth is it doesnt really matter what does matter is  length times diameter plus weight over girth divided by angle of the tip squared okay when were talking about penis size we cant just use a tape measure we need a scale  and  a protractor as well  lets look at it on the graph here  follow along with me on your study sheets kids
15,4,Cartman,why the fuck am i here
15,4,Cartman,are you saying i have problems like these fucking people
15,4,Cartman,oh thats cool
15,4,Randy,and so by dividing the weight and the girth of the penis by the angle or the what do we call it again the yaw the yaw of the shaft what we finally get is the adjusted penis size or tmi any questions so far yes little girl over there
15,4,Randy,ah good question ahh the penis is the thing were talking about that boys have that were measuring  okay any other questions okay so then lets move on to the example on your study sheet how about you could you read the first example for the class  example 1 young lady please read the problem out loud
15,4,Randy,four point four inches
15,4,Randy,seven centimeters
15,4,Randy,great and so divide by the 17 carry the 1 and we can see that randys adjusted penis size or tmi is 63 inches do we got that randys length is 44 inches but his adjusted length is 63 so how does our example person randy compare to others on the tmi scale by referring again to the tmi chart we see that a tmi of 63 is 8 inches more than the national average 
15,4,Cartman,my penis is 13 inches long
15,4,Randy,vou damn n montaire 
15,4,Randy,aw suck it all oya
15,4,Randy,you just dont go around changing math who the hell is this chick surgeon general appointed by obama

15,5,Cartman,we started with two crack babies and a camera butters did all the internet stuff weve built up to a thousand hits a day
15,5,Kyle,jesus christ
15,5,Cartman,its a good life kyle weve come here every night for dennys baconalia specials
15,5,Butters,every single night
15,5,Cartman,look at the menu bacon inside pancakes bacon meatloaf they even have a bacon sundae for dessert

15,5,Cartman,youve got a constant flow of athletes that never dries up kyle and best of all its all charity so its tax free 
15,5,Cartman,put your office right here kyle all of south park walking by looking up at you
15,5,Kyle,and it actually helps the crack babies its like volunteering but but we just make a little on the side
15,5,Cartman,somebodys gotta eat all that bacon kyle might as well be us welcome to the firm

15,5,Kyle,crack baby basketball
15,5,Stan,dude
15,5,Kyle,no no its nits not like it sounds here check it out  see look we just video the babies fighting over a ball full of crack its really getting popular  i mean it its cool because like the commercial said the crack babies had nothing before  it its great because everyone wins you know you see that two million hits  did you know theyre putting bacon inside of pancakes at dennys
15,5,Cartman,betsy macintosh
15,5,Cartman,we heard about you through the passages sobriety clinic they said youve skipped out on your rehab once again
15,5,Cartman,we need to speak with you maam 
15,5,Cartman,and so am i correct that you are eight and a half months pregnant and still addicted to cocaine
15,5,Cartman,well maam i have some exciting news  we would like your child to play for the crack baby athletic association 
15,5,Cartman,we believe that st marys is the best hospital for your child and were prepared to offer it a full ride now do you know yet if your child is male or female or so deformed youll never be able to tell
15,5,Cartman,just sign the paper and hell be playing ball for st marys
15,5,Cartman,well nothing crack baby players cant make a salary based on the rules
15,5,Cartman,i dont make the rules maam i just think them up and write them down now if youll be willing to sign right here we can get things rolling on the
15,5,Cartman,rgh maam the crack baby athletic association is a storied franchise it was founded over twelve days ago with a firm ethical code that strictly states benefits to players is detrimentalized to their wellbeing i cannot offer you or your child any cash i can however offer you a little bit of crack butters 
15,5,Kyle,dude what actually makes total sense about it if you look at it is that the crack babies are finally getting some attention and the care that they need  yeah its pretty cool dude because most of these babies would normally not even get out you know huh or be able to do anything  just because we are making money doesnt mean that those babies arent benefiting it isnt exploiting them theyre finding a useful place in society whats so unethical about that 
15,5,Stan,you sound like cartmam
15,5,Kyle,ooogh dude the thing is were not the ones that made them crack babies thats their moms goddamned fault
15,5,Stan,yeah im sure thats what cartman would say too
15,5,Kyle,i do not sound like cartman goddamnit  okay so see ya 
15,5,Cartman,its the easiest thing in the world how could you guys have screwed this up all i asked you to do was to get slash to play at half time for the match up between the crack babies at cedarssinai ncu
15,5,Cartman,slash is not hard to find hell show up to play anywhere if you pay him he played at my eighth birthday party for christs sake look look hes playing at lakewood mall right now  now you guys get down there  oh crap the president of ea sports is calling just go go  mr peters how are you yes sir were very excited about our deal with you as well  oh we know the video game version of crack baby basketball will be a big hit too  hey kyle have a seat
15,5,Kyle,i need to talk to you 
15,5,Cartman,mr peters can i call you back our company accountant needs me yes he is jewish okay thanks mr peters bye  hows it goin man
15,5,Kyle,in our deal with ea sports we are giving them the right to use images of the crack babies and their names but we arent paying the crack babies
15,5,Cartman,they cant make money its against the rules
15,5,Kyle,but this video game can make a million dollars we have to give the crack babies a piece of that
15,5,Cartman,kyle it says right there rule number 3 crack baby players cannot receive compensation of any kind for their playing
15,5,Kyle,gut theyre the ones risking injury
15,5,Cartman,what do you want me to do kyle find a stepladder of some kind and risk my safety to get up there and change the rules
15,5,Kyle,the government could come after us cartman
15,5,Cartman,were a nonprofit company kyle
15,5,Kyle,so then where did the eight hundred dollars we made from selling an internet ad to payless shoe source go
15,5,Cartman,egh to things we need to keep the office running kyle here look 
15,5,Kyle,a hot tub
15,5,Cartman,its not just a hot tub taste it go ahead taste it 
15,5,Kyle,gravy
15,5,Cartman,kentucky fried chicken gravy
15,5,Kyle,no way
15,5,Cartman,a hot tub full of kfc gravy kyle did you ever think you would see that in your lifetime  kyle as owners of this company we owe it not only to ourselves but to the crack babies to be as stressfree and clearheaded as possible mcdonalds french fries and kfc gravy the french call this poutaine
15,5,Kyle,i know but dude we cant license our games to ea sports and pay the crack babies nothing slavery is illegal
15,5,Cartman,its not illegal kyle tell you what ill do some undercover work and find out how the other companies get away with it
15,5,Kyle,what other companies
15,5,Cartman,helloo thear the name is eric p cartman im a wellrespected owner in the slave trade
15,5,Cartman,my peaches what a wonderful office you got yourself heah certainly got yourself a luuucrative bidness dont ye well let me get right down to it theyen like yourself  i am also in the slave trade  but at the moment i find myself in a little quandary with ligal issues was wonderin if you could share some secrets
15,5,Cartman,you have some might stronglookin workers heah sahr id be willin to offer you forty dollars for two of the white ones and fifty for the blacks
15,5,Cartman,student atholetes hoho that is brilliant sahr now when we sell their likeness for video games how do we get around payin for our slaves uh student atheletes then
15,5,Cartman,i aint arguin if they got paid then how did we make all owr money right
15,5,Cartman,but of course you own slaves because oh riiight  of couse you dont have desire to own slaves son neither do i and if there was any government agency listenin in on this heah conversation they should know that weer not talkin bout slave ownership gaauu  alright so now how do you get around not paying your slaves
15,5,Cartman,you think you can do whatever you want cause your corporation is a university  this country was founded on the idea that one corporation couldnt hog all the slaves while the rest of us wallow in poverteh screw you sahr im goin home 
15,5,Kyle,heres the thing whether or not im a part of it crack baby basketball is popular somebodys going to do it so the only way for me to try and help the situation is to be involved in it so that i can steer things in a direction that is more beneficial to the actual crack babies  oh its sooo easy for you isnt it i mean what do you have to do except lay there and think about what you did at school today or what you want to watch on tv tomorrow well sorry skippy but the world isnt always black and white just because some people are born poorer than others doesnt mean i cant enjoy a few mcdonalds french fries in a hot tub of gravy from kentucky fried chicken
15,5,Stan,mcdonalds french fries in a hot tub of kfc gravy
15,5,Kyle,it happens to be called poutine in montreal 
15,5,Cartman,how hard can it be clyde you walk up to slash when hes playing at the mall and you offer him a deal
15,5,Cartman,how can slash be playing in colorado springs and moscow at the same time
15,5,Cartman,look you morons slash clearly has a fan club right so just go to the post office and find out where the mail gets in and then youll have slashs home address
15,5,Cartman,yeah its a good idea now go get us slash for halftime  jesus christ  are we the only two intelligent people in this entire company kyle goddamn
15,5,Kyle,alright cartman ive been doin a lot of thinking about how the companys gonna spend the money we make off the ea sports deal were going to use thirty percent of the money to build an orphanage for the crack babies
15,5,Cartman,what
15,5,Kyle,ive designed it to be the best place for them to live a place where they can finally have the care and happiness they deserve and if you think its a bad idea i really dont care
15,5,Cartman,oh my god its genius kyle
15,5,Kyle,what
15,5,Cartman,this the answer to our problems a three hundred thousand dollar building but we buy ourselves a million dollars worth of goodwill with the public we can say we gave our student athletes a place to live and grow for a few years its like moral teflon i knew we needed a jew in this company kyle great work 
15,5,Kyle,and so thirty percent of the money we make off the licensing agreement with ea sports goes to the orphanage for the needy crack babies did you see the blueprints the babies will have their own putt putt golf course  why does it matter how much im making stan if the crack babies are getting a place to grow and develop why does my salary matter
15,5,Cartman,what
15,5,Butters,slash is makebelieve
15,5,Cartman,vunter slash
15,5,Kyle,what
15,5,Cartman,but then who played at my eighth birthday party
15,5,Cartman,but then who was the guitar player for guns n roses
15,5,Cartman,are you fucking serious 
15,5,Stan,you guys are ten years old and you just figured out that slash isnt real oh my god 
15,5,Cartman,you knew about this
15,5,Stan,my parents told me slash wasnt real when i was five jehesus christ 
15,5,Butters,well what the heck do we do now
15,5,Kyle,look lets just get our money from ea sports and get out of this whole thing once and for all
15,5,Kyle,wait a minute according to this you now own all the rights to crack baby basketball and we got nothing
15,5,Kyle,you cant do this we were gonna build an orphanage so the crack babies have somewhere to go
15,5,Cartman,i just cant believe slash isnt real
15,5,Butters,i know its messin with my head so hard
15,5,Kyle,you guys weve just been screwed over and lied to
15,5,Cartman,i know right i was always extra good before my birthday too because i was told slash would come and play for me
15,5,Kyle,its unbelievable stan ea sports just used us the entire time we worked for nothing and ea made all the money you know i dont think we actually deserved getting screwed over but but i guess making tons of money off of people who are making nothing is always gonna cause problems i know i know right we mightve got screwed but the really tragic thing is that those those poor crack babies at the hospitals are just gonna be stuck there with nowhere to go  no way  this is it
15,5,Stan,its what
15,5,Kyle,this is it stan  its just like i designed it theres the miniature gold course over there and slides and uh  excuse me what is this place
15,5,Kyle,but who paid for all this 
15,5,Stan,kyle kyle look 
15,5,Kyle,you dont think that but he isnt real

15,10,Cartman,okay well if you have a better idea then why am i here

16,1,Randy,aw you people have me on camera now
16,1,Cartman,exactly how long are we going to sit around as our freedoms are stripped away one by one its time for us to stand together and say we want the government out of our bathrooms
16,1,Cartman,now listen all we have to do is agree as a community to all bolt our toilet seats down if they cant raise or lower theres zero chance of anyone falling in
16,1,Mr. Garrison,hey yeah if theres no toilet seats the government cant make toilet seat laws 
16,1,Cartman,well sorry if women might have to deal with a little splash of pee on the rim but its a far better solution than having the government in out bathrooms right
16,1,Randy,yeah how will nelson and i make an x on sleepover nights
16,1,Cartman,well sorry but if we dont want the government treating us like children we might have to give up being able to pee out feces in half
16,1,Randy,yeah i think weve just gotta live with the tsa 
16,1,Stan,so what does that mean
16,1,Kyle,what
16,1,Randy,what good is the tsa if they arent protecting us why have we given up freedom if a terrorist can take a hostage in a bathroom with a baby and a gun on the toilet
16,1,Randy,weve all stood by as our mother government has taken out dignity
16,1,Cartman,thats right
16,1,Randy,now its time for us to take responsibility for ourselves

16,4,Kyle,i looked on the known species webpage theres no animal called a jewpacabra mentioned anywhere
16,4,Cartman,well neither is bigfoot kyle but there are a lot of people who say they have spotted a sasquatch
16,4,Kyle,if someone says they saw a sasquatch they are either lying or they are stupid now stop lying about a jewpacabra before stupid people start believing you

16,4,Butters,you think jewpacabra is here
16,4,Cartman,pretty sure jewpacabra was here
16,4,Butters,oh good maybe we scared it off
16,4,Cartman,you cant scare a jewpacabra butters dont forget were dealing with a creature that drinks blood hides in the night and has absolutely no belief in the divinity of christ  did you hear that im going to try a jewpacabra mating call now no christ no christ im really not buying this whole christ thing  hes here somewhere
16,4,Butters,oh god im scared

16,4,Butters,im not saying jesus is a lie
16,4,Cartman,butters do you wanna catch jewpacabra on camera or not  there is no christ
16,4,Butters,jesus is a lie
16,4,Cartman,no way jesus was son of god huh butters
16,4,Butters,nope i dont think christ has any basis in reality
16,4,Cartman,sh you hear that
16,4,Butters,oh hamburgers
16,4,Cartman,i didnt think you would believe me and that why last night i took it upon myself to go out and try to capture it on video  what im about to show you is the first video ever shot of a jewpacabra  and youre the first to see it  this is just after 8 pm first we heard rustling in the bushes then a strange animallike scurrying sound thats when we saw this  kay wait for it wait for it wait for it wait for it wait for  right there did you see the jewpacabra i know its so shocking it takes a minute for your brain to process what its seeing watch again  wait for it wait there  jewpacabra theres a jewpacabra in south park god help us
16,4,Cartman,it was no dog i was there im telling you this thing had no idea that jesus christ had died for our sins
16,4,Cartman,i can try to catch it but im going to need all the resources youve got if this thing isnt contained your easter egg hunt is going to be a bloodbath 
16,4,Cartman,we need to get to the city of nassau in the bahamas here 
16,4,Cartman,thats right theres a resort near there called the atlantis hotel and casino they have a water slide there that goes through a shark tank
16,4,Cartman,weeeeeee oh yes oolll check it out heheyeahehe 
16,4,Cartman,now we head back to colorado here  we need to get my video of the jewpacabra into the hands of professionals who can analyze it
16,4,Kyle,would you stop scaring everyone with your dumb ass myth
16,4,Cartman,people thought atlantis was a myth kyle but i was just there ive explored the depths of atlantis and now im about to prove a new species exists im a little james cameron
16,4,Kyle,these people arent going to prove anything to believe any of this you either have to be a liar or stupid
16,4,Cartman,these are professional people who go around tracking sasquatches kyle they arent liars and they arent stupid
16,4,Cartman,ive already done my research boys what youre looking at there is a jewpacabra
16,4,Cartman,its like a sasquatch only more elusive more ferocious and a little more greedy
16,4,Cartman,well i guess thats it youre going to have to only allow me into the easter egg hunt sir im the only one qualified
16,4,Cartman,heh what do you mean 
16,4,Cartman,well i mean it could have just been a dog
16,4,Cartman,well come on guys its probably a jewpacabra but this isnt definitive
16,4,Cartman,why

16,4,Kyle,what are you doing
16,4,Cartman,okay okay even if there was a jewpacabra it wouldnt know i was the one who got video of it huh how could it know that it couldnt know that right kyle

16,8,Mr. Mackey,uh yes weve decided to go without kickoffs because of the concerns raised over concussions mkay
16,8,Randy,oh yeah we dont want our kids getting hurt playing football but i think i have a way to make it even better why dont we have the players just wear bras
16,8,Randy,yeah the players should all wear bras and instead of helmets they should wear little tinfoil hats cause you know its the future and we shouldnt be so barbaric 
16,8,Randy,oh youre all not getting it see while were at it well have a balloon instead of a ball and whoever catches the balloon tries to run while all the other players hug
16,8,Mr. Mackey,huh you you think the students would like that
16,8,Randy,oh theyd love it a sport where safety is all that matters how about we call it sarcastaball
16,8,Mr. Mackey,hnkay would would you mind being the coach of the south park sarcastaball team

16,8,Cartman,thats true
16,8,Butters,are we just gonna let north park walk away with a victory because we think they know how to be nicer than us  bein nice is about whats inside you when your enemy is nice to you you just be nice right back and if they give you two balloons well you give them three
16,8,Butters,and when they try anand thank you for those balloons you say ah i dont need any thanks i did it cause it was the right thing to do and then you give them a smile
16,8,Butters,and when that other team tries to cover you well thats when you gotta reach deep down right down to your creamy center well that place well that place inside of you where where all the goouey happylovin goo sits and you just gotta use that and be the nicest most compassionate player youve ever been and let the world know that we will not fall down so easy

16,11,Butters,whats saimin
16,11,Kenny,my dearest friendsi am living amongst the natives in the remote and tiny island of kavai what can i tell you of this mysterious island and its people it is a place of wonder and yet to the outsider like me a place of odd tradition the people here are peaceful and joyous and seem to care little for the rush and worry of the outside world their diet is mostly an odd mixture of coconut milk pineapple juice and vodka which they call the chichi as for butters he is quickly learning the ways of his ancestors and seems to be feeling better with every passing day he still seems quite angry at times but luckily his ceremony will finally take place on the morrow
16,11,Stan,on the morrow what the fuck is wrong with kenny
16,11,Kenny,to wit i have found nothing wrong with this remote place and i must admit it will be with some melancholy that i will leave this island and return homei saw this chick in a bikini on the beach too she had the nicest boobs everhumbly yours kenneth
16,11,Butters,whoa its like gasoline
16,11,Butters,hey uh now i do feel butter uh better
16,11,Butters,ive never done this before 
16,11,Butters,aim my anger stupid  ben affleck  waaah 
16,11,Kenny,what about me
16,11,Butters,no kennys my friend hes the only kid at school i actually like you buncha jerks
16,11,Butters,he wont betray us will you kenny
16,11,Kenny,no im not going to fucking betray anybody
16,11,Butters,kenny be careful
16,11,Kenny,whoops
16,11,Butters,kenny
16,11,Butters,well i dont know about the rest of ya but im sick and tired of bein pushed around all the time i came all the way down here for my hapa noa ceremony and i cant even have it cause the fucking haoles have to ruin everything
16,11,Butters,well if you ask me the only good haole is a dead haole with a with a stick up his butthole and his wiener cut off rraahhhh
16,11,Butters,stupid greedy haoles kill them all
16,11,Butters,surrender no the heck with that
16,11,Butters,well i wont do it you hear me im not licking anybodys testes
16,11,Butters,no this is our home and im sick of everyone who thinks theyre better than me just cause theyve got good looks and just cause even after massacring daredevil they happen to come back and hit a home run that everyone likes you shouldnt be able to be goodlooking and be with jennifer lopez and be a good director  all right all right fine argo is a good movie there i admitted it i told people that it didnt hold up but it holds up god darn it ben affleck has everything gragh
16,11,Kenny,my dear friends of the mainlandwhat adventures i have found on the tiny island of kavai i have truly become one with the natives who found new courage to fight their oppressors
16,11,Kenny,the american government finally gave in to the natives and had the mahalo rewards cards reinstated our two cultures it appears will once again live in peace
16,11,Kenny,with the war at an end our butters is able to have his hapa noa ceremony and with any help from the gods become his old cheery self again
16,11,Butters,yeah i guess so except it still doesnt change the fact that ben affleck gets to be handsome talented and then gets to go home and kiss jennifer lopez
16,11,Butters,what really but i thought i was totally jealous of him hes just married to jennifer gardner oh my god i feel so much better 
16,11,Kenny,you do
16,11,Butters,yeah ogh i like that ben affleck guy hes a good filmmaker come on kenny i guess i owe the kids at school an apology  did you see argo kenny its a pretty good movie ben affleck has a lot goin for him not everything but a lot whoopie

16,14,Butters,please eric i tried to be quiet i swear
16,14,Cartman,shhh its okay butters  nobodys gonna find the election ballots  i have them hidden away somewhere nobody would ever look  a place in town people barely even know exists
16,14,Cartman,cut the crap mouse you only care about the election results because romney would have been tougher on the chinese
16,14,Cartman,trust me theyre somewhere nobody will ever find them if you kill me then obama will stay president and you will lose star wars to the chinese forever
16,14,Cartman,i can get those at kmart if you want me to switch sides youll have to do better than that
16,14,Cartman,i want a part in the new movies
16,14,Cartman,i get to be luke skeywalkers son and there has to be a character called jewbacca

16,14,Stan,well i mean look at it this way almost half the country did actually vote for obama if the election really just came down to a bunch of boxes cartman stole then does it matter that much
16,14,Kyle,it matters stan it it matters
16,14,Stan,stan when was the last time you saw somebody drive a hummer
16,14,Stan,uhhh forever ago like 2010

17,7,Cartman,what do you mean
17,7,Butters,well ihits just that they have a lot of girls boobs and vaginas and stuff but most times they show a mans wiener its because that guys in a love scene with another guy do you think its because gay wieners are less threatening to women viewers

17,7,Cartman,im not sure if his heart is in the right place if he were to everswitch sidesit could make stans army problematic for us
17,7,Kenny,but stan and kyle are best friends
17,7,Cartman,true but we cant let kyle come in the way of whats rightfully ourslets face it lady mccormick this is really about you and me getting xbox ones the others are simply there to help us get inside those doors

17,8,Cartman,it isnt that princess kenny is loved by her army but stan is still the nuts and ball of her operationit would be a huge setback to the traitors getting their playstations if stan were to begrounded
17,8,Kyle,grounded for what
17,8,Cartman,that could be up to you
17,8,Kyle,no cartman you said nobody will have to be grounded were not playing dirty
17,8,Cartman,fine sir kyle perhaps youre rightdid you know that stans dad is working a temp job as mall security

17,8,Cartman,you cant win this guys look around you lay down your weapons and you can come back and fight for xboxes with us on black friday
17,8,Kenny,you can change your mind instead of fighting with us eric
17,8,Stan,the princess says that if you wanna change your mind and agree that playstations are better shell consider it
17,8,Cartman,kenny we all understand wanting to play as the chick once in a while kay but you are never going to be a real princess
17,8,Kenny,what oh the nerve how insensitive of you you cocksucking faggot
17,8,Stan,the princess calls you a balllicking lesbian
17,8,Cartman,that doesnt even make sense

17,8,Stan,whatistarted how dare you
17,8,Kyle,all these people are going to be gaming on xbox you really wanna just game with craig the rest of your life

17,8,Cartman,youre outnumbered ten to one and theres no time left how will you win
17,8,Stan,the gods will find us a way

17,8,Butters,whatoyou mean
17,8,Kenny,wooo
17,8,Randy,my friends the time is almost here let us face these shoppers with the bravery of those mall security officers before uscommander marsh  theyre what  theyre gonna what
17,9,Kenny,tadaima
17,9,Kenny,purincessu kenni reporuto
17,9,Kenny,hai purincessu kenni assisuto
17,9,Kenny,minnasan kenni kimasu
17,9,Cartman,he did what he flew down in a parachute and did what
17,9,Cartman,because because what because hes cute
17,9,Kyle,cartman hes got everyone on sonys side we cant stop him
17,9,Cartman,but what does he do besides that hes cute
17,9,Cartman,tell bill gates to suck my ass mommomdont seriously tell bill gates to suck my ass tell him everythings cool and ill call him in a little bit
17,9,Kyle,this would have never happened if you would have let kenny be a princess in the first place
17,9,Cartman,hes not a princess hes a dude
17,9,Kyle,well unfortunately for us hes now on the other side we are out of options
17,9,Cartman,so what are you saying kyle
17,9,Kyle,i have an ideai dont like it but i think its the only choice we have
17,9,Stan,alright guys heres the deal the main entrance to the mall is already blocked by thousands of waiting shoppers the kids who want xboxes plan to flank from the left hereour best chance of being first inside is finding a way to the malls back entrance here
17,9,Stan,the key to us being the first ones inside is taking over the red robin before black friday starts
17,9,Stan,i have no idea
17,9,Stan,yes
17,9,Stan,what
17,9,Kyle,go ahead and tell him cartman
17,9,Cartman,alright on behalf of the xbox fighters of zaron we hereby lay down our arms and give up okay
17,9,Cartman,shut up craig this is very difficult you guys win alright well all play on playstation 4s we still think xbox is the superior machine but you got too many people on your side and then kenny became a japanese princess
17,9,Kyle,look the truth is we all have a bigger problem now and you know it nobody is going to get anything if we dont work together against those thousands of other shoppers
17,9,Stan,so better a ps4 than nothing is that it i think well take our chances on our own
17,9,Cartman,we know a way inside the red robinyou dont think youre the only ones that thought of it we were going to use the red robin entrance too and we figured out how
17,9,Kyle,red robin can be rented out for wedding parties if we all chip in we can pay for the deposit to have the wedding party there
17,9,Kyle,lets do this together dudeour only shot at playing any nextgen console is by teaming up if you wanna game on a ps4 then i do too
17,9,Stan,and you swear youll be okay with that you wont talk about the xbox being better ever again
17,9,Kyle,i swear stan
17,9,Stan,alright guys looks like we have a wedding to plan
17,9,Kenny,minnasan ii yo purincessu kenni ganbaru
17,9,Kenny,ha ueddingu
17,9,Cartman,kennychan please come home at once our two houses have found peace come to the red robin wedding and we will accept you as the princess you are yours truly the wizard king
17,9,Kenny,waaah sugoichan
17,9,Kenny,minnasan sayonara ima purincessu kenni tomodachi ni kaerimasu
17,9,Kenny,purincessu kenni daijobu dayo
17,9,Cartman,sir stan i was hoping i could talk to you about the wedding
17,9,Stan,yeah sure what about it
17,9,Cartman,i think its best that when the time comes for the mall to open we should stay back a bit from the doors
17,9,Stan,why
17,9,Cartman,well think about itthe first people inside are gonna have to take on the brunt of the holiday shoppers from the main entrance its best we let butters and scott malkinson go first while they fight we can simply slip on by
17,9,Stan,oh okay i guess that makes sense but butters and scott wont be able to get their ps4s
17,9,Cartman,yes thats true but lets face sir stan this is all about you and me getting playstations the rest are simply there to help us get through
17,9,Cartman,dude dude
17,9,Cartman,dude shut the fuck up
17,9,Stan,who is that
17,9,Cartman,hes just this old crazy guy who gets pissed off because im in his garden all the time

17,9,Stan,i didnt even know he was working at the mall kyle

18,1,Kyle,yeah i just well i just thought our company name would be more like uh ororiginal
18,1,Cartman,its a strong name dude its like agressive and masculine like boner forest but boner forest was taken
18,1,Kyle,yeah but maybe we need a name thats more affirming like shows what we stand for
18,1,Cartman,we dont stand for anything remember our company plan guys  start up cash in sell out bro down
18,1,Kyle,im just not sure this is the name people are gonna give money to

18,1,Kyle,no way
18,1,Cartman,sittin on our asses here we come
18,1,Cartman,by pledging just one or two dollars you are helping us in our fervent quest to not have to do stuff if you pledge 10 or more you will receive this luxurious company micro badge
18,1,Cartman,washington redskins go fuck yourself  sure wed be happy to take your money yup go to our kickstarter page okay nice idiot uh huh fuck you bye bye

18,1,Butters,washington redskins go fuck yourself
18,1,Cartman,how is it offensive
18,1,Cartman,guys guys we have total respect for you when we name our company washington redskins it was out of deep appreciation for your team and your people 
18,1,Cartman,mmmm noooo because i dont want to aaaand we cant just change the name of our company cause its like super hard but hey from one redskin to another go fuck yourself 
18,1,Cartman,dude this is sooo cool we only have six days to go before all the money pledged to our company becomes liquid
18,1,Kyle,guys we need to talk to you i really dont think we wanna be a company that isis looks up to we should maybe issue a statement saying that we dont sanction them
18,1,Cartman,oh no no you guys we started this company to do nothing if we start doing stuff now itll put it all at risk
18,1,Kyle,people arent gonna support our company if we dig in our heels and say we dont care about anything
18,1,Cartman,digging in our heels and pissing on public opinion us what the washington redskins are all about  now come on guys if you wanna be a successful business then you have to be honest about what you are  once you take a stand on something youre pretending like your company is about more than money then all of a sudden youre the nfl and and your players get caught molesting little boys
18,1,Kyle,thats the catholic church
18,1,Cartman,nfl catholic church same thing okay lets use the catholic church you take a moral stand on issues you say youre about honor and integrity and the next thing you know your clergymen are getting caught beating up their wives in an elevator
18,1,Kyle,thats the nfl
18,1,Cartman,its the same thing kyle the point is if we as an organization claim to be about high morality somebody is eventually going to get raped or beaten in an elevator and its most likely going to be butters
18,1,Butters,oh no
18,1,Kyle,all right i really dont want to have to do this but im not happy with the direction this company is taking
18,1,Cartman,well what are you gonna do go back to school im not going back there man
18,1,Kyle,maybe ill start my own company
18,1,Cartman,well thats fine you cant call yourself washington redskins
18,1,Kyle,i dont want to its a stupid name 
18,1,Cartman,well i guess everythings out on the table now huh kyle
18,1,Kyle,yeah i guess i guess everything is
18,1,Cartman,stan do you think our name is stupid too
18,1,Stan,i dont know i but i dont know if my future is with this company either
18,1,Cartman,well then i wish you both well in your new venture goodbye 
18,1,Butters,hang on is this the company where i dont get raped yeah hehere right okay im uh stayin here
18,1,Cartman,fuck youuuu fuck youuuu fuck you up there fuck you fuck you those words mean a great deal to us they help us express just how we as a company see things differently there are a lot of startup companies on kickstarter but after today i think youll agree that washington redskins is the most exciting as you know the redskins have been on the forefront of kickstarter as a company that is always finding new and exciting ways to tell people to go fuck themselves and now our company is thrilled to show you all the latest innovations weve come up with  to begin with we have moved the couch from the left side of the office to the right side but we didnt stop there we also added a new rug that goes better with our office drapes and probably most exciting of all we have actually updated the company from the inside out we received a lot of pressure from certain communities to change our redskins logo as a company we want to be firm but we also want to be flexible and so we thought if we have to change our logo it should be more in step with todays times but still define us as the leading kickstarter company what we came up with is the new company logo that i think youll all agree is very exciting  now when people hear the name redskins they will immediately think titties and balls its just a bold new way that we can say we dont fucking care go redskins 
18,1,Kyle,its so awesome dude our company already has a hundred backers and we still have 14 days to go
18,1,Stan,yeah
18,1,Kyle,you okay bro
18,1,Stan,i just never saw myself owning a company called furry balls plopped menacingly on the table inc
18,1,Kyle,give it time itll grow on you
18,1,Stan,why dont we just call it untitled startup company
18,1,Kyle,because that sounds like we dont have anything weve been through this already stan
18,1,Stan,yeah i know that but a good company should never have seven words in its title
18,1,Kyle,well whattaya mean
18,1,Stan,i just feel that somewhere out there theres a perfect startup company name and i need to be free to go find it
18,1,Kyle,oh well i certainly dont want you to feel that furry balls plopped menacingly on the table is holding you back 
18,1,Stan,good luck with your company dude
18,1,Kyle,yeah good luck with yours 
18,1,Cartman,goooood morning guys
18,1,Butters,happy deadline day
18,1,Cartman,we made it guys we cab finally stop doing stuff and see just how much our company made in 4 3 2 1 thats the deadline
18,1,Butters,oh boy this is like christmas morning
18,1,Cartman,what the hell cant find the server  kickstartercom  kickstarter where is kickstarter get it up on the phone butters come on i wanna know how much our company is worth
18,1,Butters,its not coming up on my phone either i holy mother mary
18,1,Kenny,what
18,1,Butters,somebody raided kickstarter and they burned the building to the ground
18,1,Cartman,what
18,1,Butters,somebody killed kickstarter
18,1,Cartman,who the hell would burn kickstarter to the ground  oh my god that weird little jewy guy kyle
18,1,Kyle,what the hell is wrong cant find the server kickstarter 
18,1,Cartman,you song of a bitch
18,1,Kyle,what
18,1,Cartman,you broke kickstarter
18,1,Kyle,no i just cant get it to load
18,1,Cartman,nobody can its gone you just couldnt take it that our company was more successful than yours would ever be
18,1,Kyle,my company was on kickstarter too why would i get rid of it
18,1,Cartman,well somebody did
18,1,Stan,it doesnt matter you guys theres something a lot more important here  do you guys remember when we first decided to start a company together we all had a common goal and we werent gonna let anything stop us from getting to the bro down but somewhere between starting up and selling out we we lost our way we cant do this on our own we need each other
18,1,Kyle,hes right we should do a merger
18,1,Cartman,a merger its too late for that you guys kickstarter is gone we dont have a company we dont have anything 
18,1,Kyle,yes we do we have a sweet name  i was wrong cartman washington redskins is the perfect name i think maybe i was jealous that i didnt come up with it
18,1,Cartman,it is really sweet
18,1,Stan,and we always said that all we needed was a sweet name and the rest would figure itself out
18,1,Butters,yeah we can do it fellas itll be like old times
18,1,Kyle,whattaya say cartman
18,1,Cartman,fuck you fuck you everyone yes fuck you all thanks  how do you stay relevant in a volatile marketplace as you know our goal at washington redskins is to not do anything and make money not doing it
18,1,Kyle,when kickstarter went down many saw their startup projects die but here at washington redskins we saw opportunity people still need a way to raise money for their stupid startup projects and with the redskins you can now go fund yourself  and the idea is simple you the people go out and raise all your own money and give the washington redskins 5
18,1,Cartman,you will literally be giving us money for doing absolutely nothing it is the biggest fuck you we have ever come up with but we didnt stop there because a new company direction also means of course a new and improved logo 
18,1,Stan,boy this is the life huh guys
18,1,Butters,we finally did it
18,1,Cartman,i just might sit here until my ass fuses into the couch 
18,1,Kyle,what the heck is that 
18,1,Cartman,whoa whoa what
18,1,Kyle,change our name
18,1,Stan,but you all thought our name was sweet

18,3,Sharon,all right  do you know why young people like lorde so much  its because shes something different kids have had pop music artists flash tits and crotch in their face and most kids are actually smart enough to be sick of it lorde represents something in all of us the truth that wants to be heard if i could talk to lorde right now you know what id tell her id tell her not to let people change who she is id tell her that if people are making fun of her its probably because they lost touch with being human id tell her to keep on doing what she does because when someones not allowed to express who they are inside then we all lose thats what i would say to lorde 
18,3,Cartman,i dont wanna use the girls bathroom if anyone can use it its gonna be all crowded

18,6,Randy,all right and if you two stop then we wont have a problem anymorehm earthy bold hint of cherry aftertones uurp
18,6,Kyle,but you accepted money from the canadian government to push a freemium game on us why would they do that
18,6,Cartman,how do you get people addicted to crack you give it away for free you give away a little taste and then and then some people cant stop themselves
18,6,Cartman,and now stan is so consumed by the shit youve been pushing that he cant even see through it how could you sell out your friend
18,6,Kyle,youhaveyour crutches

18,6,Stan,one
18,6,Randy,oh its just nothing to you isnt it
18,6,Stan,no no its not
18,6,Randy,you need to realize that you have something in your brain that you somehow inherited from your grandpa that makes you act this way okay
18,6,Stan,i dont know how you can say that when youre standing here chugging beer
18,6,Randy,i am not chugging beerim sampling a flight of glutenfree german lagers with a french wine pairing its called a smorgaswein and its elegantly cultural

18,6,Kyle,sure come on guys
18,6,Stan,its not your fault its something to do with my family its like a curse
18,6,Stan,how
18,6,Kyle,we have to find a way to get the word out people need to know pushers are being hired to take advantage of people with addiction problems there has to be a way that we can get to the news company and sneak in and somehow borrow their tv signal if we could disguise ourselves as something ridiculous then
18,6,Cartman,its done
18,6,Kyle,wuh whats done
18,6,Cartman,the word is outterrance  phillip hire pushers to make money off addicts i tweeted itits trending

1,6,Stan,dammit you know i think that if parents would spend less time worrying about what their kids watch on tv and more time worrying about whats going in in their kids lives this world would be a much better place
1,6,Kyle,yeah i think that parents only get so offended by television because the rely on it as a babysitter and the sole educator of their kids
1,6,Kenny,you know what i think basically if you let the decision of what you watch stop at the parents control then what can you see itll stay the same because theyll just get offended although their kids are not delighted with the television series they put on for their kids
1,6,Stan,totally dude
1,6,Kyle,good point man

2,17,Kyle,big corporations are good
2,17,Kyle,because without big corporations we wouldnt have things like cars and computers and canned soup
2,17,Stan,even harbucks coffee started off as a small little business but because it made such great coffee and because they ran their business so well they managed to grow and grow until it became the corporate powerhouse it is today and that is why we should all let harbucks stay

3,2,Randy,the little boy combusted because he had a new girlfriend it wasnt the girl that caused him to combust it was the fact that kenny did not want to pass gas in front of her  you see as food is digested the natural processes give off a byproduct known as methane gas  the methane gathers here in the bowel area  where it causes pressure normally a person would expel this byproduct in the form of a pleasant fart  should the gas not be expelled  the methane can build up and then ignite  leading to disaster  kenny combusted because he held his farts in for too long

4,1,Cartman,well what the hell do you expect huh now i got your stupid game tell me how to break out of here
4,1,Cartman,but you said
4,1,Cartman,i thought that
4,1,Cartman,i want my moomm 
4,1,Cartman,mommy i want my mommy 
4,1,Cartman,you will
4,1,Stan,okay go ahead and start
4,1,Kyle,i dont start you start
4,1,Stan,oh uhyeah  hello mr governor and thank you for taking the time to hear our presentation on hatecrime laws entitled hate crime laws a savage hypocrisy  yes over the past few years our great country has been developing new hate crime laws
4,1,Kyle,and we think that that is  a savage hypocrisy because all crimes are hate crimes if a man beats another man because that man was sleeping with his wife is that not a hate crime
4,1,Stan,if a person vandalizes a government building is it not because of his hate for the government
4,1,Stan,mayor it is time to stop splitting people into groups all hate crimes do is support the idea that blacks are different from whites that homosexuals need to be treated differently from nonhomos that we arent the same
4,1,Kyle,but instead we should all be treated the same with the same laws and the same punishments for the same crimes  for in that way cartman can be freed from prison and we  will have a chance to win the sledding race on thursday
4,1,Stan,that is our presentation an idea that we call
4,1,Cartman,whats the matter
4,1,Cartman,uhokay

4,8,Kyle,i know your familys poor but you cant just eat an entire bowl of mints for dinner
4,8,Kenny,ah fuck you 
4,8,Stan,i dont think we stand a chance in this debate cause wendys leading the other side
4,8,Kyle,dude youre just saying that because shes your girlfriend
4,8,Kenny,hey can i have a drink of water
4,8,Kyle,yeah you can have a drink of water the dispensers over there 
4,8,Stan,yeah you must be thirsty after eating 60 mints 
4,8,Kyle,pretty good i guess
4,8,Stan,do you think they should change the flag
4,8,Kyle,kenny ate all the mints dad
4,8,Kyle,oh
4,8,Kenny,what  oh ooooooooooooooh 
4,8,Stan,that was a good one
4,8,Mr. Garrison,oohh im sorry chef mr hat is a racist son of a bitch
4,8,Mr. Garrison,dont apologize for me to that spearchucker
4,8,Mr. Garrison,dugh  ogh waaaaah 
4,8,Chef,how can you all just stand by and let these racists do this
4,8,Chef,aw the hell with all of you indecisive bastards
4,8,Cartman,uh huh
4,8,Cartman,why dont we just talk about the swastika
4,8,Cartman,i mean germany was united under the swastika right but obviously history wasnt as important as changing the views after the war and stuff so hey changed it
4,8,Cartman,yeah
4,8,Cartman,cool
4,8,Cartman,really mine too what i really like to do is i like to take the tops off of two cookies and then put them together and make quadruple stuffs
4,8,Cartman,no way
4,8,Cartman,me neither 
4,8,Cartman,huh
4,8,Cartman,whoa
4,8,Cartman,ur ssorry  go ahead
4,8,Mr. Garrison,mr hat what do you think youre doing
4,8,Mr. Garrison,theres another klan rally tonight i have to be there in 15 minutes
4,8,Mr. Garrison,ooh no mr hat you are not dragging to another klan meeting
4,8,Mr. Garrison,but theyre electing a new assistant to the grand dragon i might get elected
4,8,Mr. Garrison,well good for you puppet pants ill have nothin to do with it
4,8,Mr. Garrison,im going whether you like it or not
4,8,Mr. Garrison,oh yeah  im not going mr hat and thats final  lets just see you try and go without me  mimr hat
4,8,Cartman,ahh 
4,8,Cartman,okay it will be like this forever
4,8,Chef,i aint gonna listen to nothin this whole crackerass town can kiss my ass 
4,8,Kyle,our main point is that the flag shouldnt offend anyone because killing has been around since the beginning of time all animals kill  and the animals that dont kill are stupid ones like cows and turtles and stuff so people should not be so upset about killing 
4,8,Chef,whoa whoa whooaa you just missed the point entirely
4,8,Kyle,huh
4,8,Chef,im not mad because the flag shows somebody gettin killed its because its racist
4,8,Chef,children dont you even know what this argument is about that flag is racist because a black man is being hung by white people
4,8,Chef,ooooooohhh
4,8,Kyle,wwe really didnt see it that way
4,8,Chef,but thats a black man up there
4,8,Kyle,yyeah but the color of someones skin doesnt matter
4,8,Chef,well of course it matters when  oh my god wait a minute you children didnt even see the flag as a black man being hanged by white people did you
4,8,Chef,why that is that is the most beautiful thing i have ever heard
4,8,Chef,dont you see all this time i thought these little crackers had turned racist when actually they were so not racist that they didnt even make a separation of black and white to begin with all they saw when they looked at that flag was five people
4,8,Kyle,yeah 
4,8,Chef,im sorry children i was wrong about you but i still the flag needs to be changed but now i realize that i almost let racism turn me into a racist
4,8,Chef,oh i know you dont jimbo ive known you for almost ten years youre a good man
4,8,Chef,i think thats a much better start than me tryin to separate myself from all you wonderful crackers
4,8,Kyle,oh sweet dude i dont think we have to do this stupid debate now  stan
4,8,Stan,wait i dont get it
4,8,Kyle,no see theres people of all colors and they added a black guy as one of the hangers too so its not racist

4,9,Cartman,chef god told me i was to start a boy band and make 10 million dollars the problem is it isnt working i mean  i feel the music burning inside me but i just cant express it right you know 
4,9,Chef,well eric i i think you were just focusin in on the wrong thing boy bands arent about music boy bands are created by corporations to make money theyre all based on the gomlich effect
4,9,Cartman,whats the gomlich effect
4,9,Chef,the law of physics that states if one girl screams for something it will make other girls scream and then it grows exponentiously until all girls within a fivemile radius are screaming
4,9,Cartman,so how do boy bands use that
4,9,Chef,all they do is make videos showing tons and tons of girls screaming for the boy band once you get girls screaming you cant stop em theyre crazy  uhuh except for lilian of course

4,9,Randy,no  nooo 
4,9,Stan,dad what the hell is going on
4,9,Randy,i was i was 18 when my highschool mens choir performed at the grand opening of a sportinggoods store in denver  i was just one of fifteen members and i had no idea that a record producer was in the audience 
4,9,Randy,uh sure
4,9,Randy,ohh thanks
4,9,Randy,what me do you like my singing that much
4,9,Randy,oh my god i dont know i mean i still have another year of high school and i
4,9,Randy,no wait i mean ahill think about it
4,9,Randy,and just like that i left everything i dropped out of high school
4,9,Randy,see ya 
4,9,Randy,i said goodbye to my girlfriend
4,9,Randy,see ya 
4,9,Randy,and i left my family
4,9,Randy,see ya 
4,9,Randy,and suddenly there i was thrown into a group with four other young men who i didnt even know 
4,9,Randy,its obvious to me girl
4,9,Randy,the songs were terrible but believe it or not the country ate them up the next thing i knew we were the biggest thing in the world 
4,9,Randy,now give it to me cause
4,9,Randy,i had everything a huge house  and all the women you can imagine  and then one day just as quick as it started
4,9,Randy,hey mr allens
4,9,Randy,who are they 
4,9,Randy,but wwere still selling records right
4,9,Randy,im 19
4,9,Randy,they said that after all the money we had made we were in debt to the studio so they towed my car
4,9,Randy,the women all left
4,9,Randy,and they took back my house
4,9,Randy,ugh 
4,9,Randy,the only thing i could do was come back to colorado and face everyone that i had abandoned
4,9,Randy,and so you see stanley i do know what im talking about
4,9,Stan,jesus christ i never knew
4,9,Randy,i didnt want you to know because now im a joke ever since then ive wished every single day that i could go back to that moment when i was offered the job and say no because all the fame and the money the women all it did was build me up so that i could be knocked down harder than anybody in the world  that is what being in a boy band is all about stanley  its people smothering you and embracing you and loving you and then spitting you out and throwing you away like you were last nights pork chops now we wander the earth in disarrayus new kids on the block the osmonds were all the same and that is why you cant go to the mall

4,16,Stan,way back in the long long ago we all lived by the birthgivers laws but the birthgivers were unfair they made us go to bed early and eat broccoli 
4,16,Stan,and so the fatass came up with a way to have all the birthgivers disappear  by using the magic m word 
4,16,Stan,soon we were without power water or fresh food but we tried to survive under the guidance of the provider 
4,16,Stan,the fatass and us disagreed on how to worship the provider the fatass tried to make us follow his way by making himself the school principal so we made ourselves the superintendents of school but then he just made himself the mayor the town split sides and thats when the provider got angry 
4,16,Stan,so now every night the provider must be appeased at carousel we need their book so one of ours doesnt die 
4,16,Stan,we all know that one day the provider will set us free make everything like it was in the before time in the long long ago

5,1,Mr. Garrison,no no filmore you can say i have to poop and shit or oh shit i have to poop but not i have to shit are we all clear
5,1,Mr. Garrison,look its all about context well for example recently i have come out and admitted that i was a homosexual im gay that means that now i can say the word fag on television they usually dont allow fag but because im gay its alright and with the new approval of the word shit that means that finally i am free to sayhey there shitty shitty fag fagshitty shitty fag fag how do you dohey there shitty shitty fag fagshitty shitty fag fag how do you do oh this is great
5,1,Mr. Mackey,oh i dont really give a shit ive done enough shit outside today and shit

5,1,Stan,this sucks now that shits out it isnt fun to say it anymore
5,1,Cartman,yeah theyve taken all the fun out of shit were gonna have to start saying other bad words like cock and fuck and meecrob 
5,1,Stan,whats meecrob
5,1,Cartman,you know that stuff you get as an appetizer at thai food restaurants meecrob dude is way grosser than shit dude id scarf down a whole wet bucket full of shit before i ate another plate of meecrob 
5,1,Kyle,you guys you guys ive looked up the word shit i think it might have something to do with people dying
5,1,Stan,what
5,1,Kyle,havent you noticed everyone getting sick it all started when they said shit on television
5,1,Cartman,oh kyle you are so full of meecrob
5,1,Kyle,i am not full of meecro what look the word shit first showed up in english in the 1340s the same time as something called the black death
5,1,Stan,whats that
5,1,Cartman,kyle do you still have sand in your vagina about us not going to the lion king with you i mean shit dude let it go
5,1,Kyle,look it might be a coincidence but i think wed better ask someone come on 
5,1,Chef,baby you are so fine and shitthe shit you do the shit you say id jump on your shit any day oh hello there children
5,1,Kyle,chef do you know where shit comes from
5,1,Chef,uh from your ass children
5,1,Kyle,no no the word shit
5,1,Chef,oh
5,1,Cartman,detective sandy vagina here  thinks that shit might have something to do with everyone getting sick
5,1,Kyle,ungh it said in my book that the word shit started exactly the same time as something called the black death
5,1,Chef,the black death are you sure
5,1,Stan,whats the black death chef
5,1,Chef,latoya jackson children
5,1,Chef,but i think back in those days it meant something else the plague
5,1,Chef,it says here the word shit has been around for over 600 years it comes from the anglosaxon word skite
5,1,Kyle,right but in the 1340s people in england stopped calling it skite and started calling it shit the same year as the black plague
5,1,Chef,the black plague over half of europe was killed by it
5,1,Stan,look theyre puking out their intestines just like the people here 
5,1,Chef,look at this children  it says that the people in england believed that the plague was a curse a dark magic infliction brought on by a mass utterance of a word of curse
5,1,Stan,word of curse
5,1,Kyle,a curse word
5,1,Chef,of course ive never even thought about why we use the term curse word before
5,1,Stan,because it brings a curse like the black death
5,1,Cartman,you guys look here  in this nancy drew mystery nancy goes to the beach and gets sand trapped in her shoe this could explain how kyle got it in his vagina
5,1,Kyle,cartman this is serious
5,1,Cartman,so am i kyle if that sand in your vagina doesnt get released you could become a walking time bomb 
5,1,Stan,holy shit
5,1,Cartman,ohho gross
5,1,Kyle,dude this plague is spreading like wildfire 
5,1,Stan,uh oh
5,1,Kenny,uh oh
5,1,Cartman,kennys got it heh heh
5,1,Kyle,weve gotta do something chef if we dont we dont stop that network  shit will become an even more acceptable word
5,1,Chef,children weve got to warn those producers in hollywood that the plague and shit could be linked
5,1,Cartman,goddamn it kenny dont get your plague germs on me
5,1,Kyle,cartman stop being an asshole 
5,1,Chef,hold on a minute mr producer
5,1,Chef,my name is chef and these are the children weve come to warn you about shit
5,1,Chef,hey hold on a minute
5,1,Chef,havent you people noticed all the strange things going on
5,1,Kyle,we think that you might have could it by helping make shit an everyday word 
5,1,Kyle,its true we think that word might be plaguing our friend kenny
5,1,Kyle,no
5,1,Cartman,but we can keep the halo the turtle dolls right
5,1,Chef,damn crackerass producers
5,1,Stan,now what are we gonna do chef
5,1,Chef,i dont know children i guess weve got to get the word out to people some other way
5,1,Stan,oh shit
5,1,Chef,who are you
5,1,Stan,what are we supposed to do with it
5,1,Kyle,now what
5,1,Chef,weve got to find people who would know what the hell this is all about children were goin to have to go to the land of castles knights and kings
5,1,Chef,scuse me do you work here
5,1,Kyle,we need some help identifying an ancient english stone
5,1,Stan,it might hold the key to a curse
5,1,Stan,dude we need help from the british
5,1,Chef,we just need help identifying this 
5,1,Stan,you know what it is
5,1,Chef,uh yeah we didnt mean to
5,1,Stan,well yeah but i dont think that we knew curse word meant curse word
5,1,Chef,but i dont get it people use curse words all the time
5,1,Chef,knights of standards and practices
5,1,Randy,ya know that words kind of getting old its not really funny anymore
5,1,Mr. Garrison,well they cant use fag because you cant say fag unless youre a homosexual
5,1,Randy,really so we cant say 
5,1,Mr. Garrison,no see you got beeped
5,1,Mr. Garrison,thats right
5,1,Randy,hey you didnt get beeped
5,1,Mr. Garrison,well well well guess we learned something new about you jimbo you freakin fag you wanna make out or something
5,1,Mr. Garrison,oh boy this show is really reaching for plot now
5,1,Stan,look theres the fword
5,1,Kyle,and asshole
5,1,Cartman,i knew it meecrob  meecrob is a curse word god must hate it as much as i do
5,1,Stan,all the world destroyed
5,1,Cartman,my house too
5,1,Chef,oh no
5,1,Chef,tonight is the night of a million shits on hbc its gonna be said over and over
5,1,Randy,i i cant follow this shitty storyline at all
5,1,Kyle,wait 
5,1,Cartman,oh boy that thing has really got sand in its vagina 
5,1,Cartman,what a stupid voice
5,1,Kyle,its okay the curse has been lifted 
5,1,Stan,yeah we all gotta make sure it doesnt come back
5,1,Kyle,you see weve learned something today swearing can be fun but doing it all the time causes a lot of problems
5,1,Kyle,were all saying the sword too much 
5,1,Kyle,the knights of standards and practices were created to make sure that bad words were kept to a minimum curse words theyre called that because they are a curse we have to go back to only using curse words in rare extreme circumstances
5,1,Stan,and besides too much use of a dirty word takes away from its impact we believe in free speech and all that but keeping a few words taboo just adds to the fun of english
5,1,Cartman,so please everyone from now on youve got to try and watch your language 
5,1,Randy,that makes sense
5,1,Mr. Garrison,is this still part of the show
5,1,Chef,im very proud of you children lets all go home and find a nice white woman to make love to
5,1,Stan,yeah and kenny didnt die

5,4,Cartman,yehes im afraid this isnt your chili scott i switched it with chefs  its delicious chef i hadnt planned on that what i did plan on however was that my friends stan and kyle would betray me and warn you that the chili con carnival was a trap  i assumed that they would tell you that i had trained denkins pony to bite off your wiener what they didnt tell you was that denkins is a crazy redneck who shoots trespassers on sight knowing that you would try and do something to the pony i warned mr denkins that violent pony killers were in the area  i also know that you wouldnt go yourself for fear of having your wiener bitten off you would most likely send your parents  and im afraid that when mr denkins spotted them on his property he shot and killed both your parents 
5,4,Cartman,i came just in time to see mr denkins giving his report to officer barbrady and of course to steal the bodies  after a night with the hacksaw i was all ready to put on my chili con carnival so that i could tell you personally about your parents demise and of course feed you your chili  do you like it do you like it scott  i call it mr  mrs tenorman chili

5,7,Chef,look schools are teaching condom use to younger and younger students each day but sex isnt something that should be taught in textbooks and diagrams sex is emotional and spiritual it needs to be taught by family i know it can be hard parents but if you leave it up to the schools to teach sex to kids you dont know who theyre learning it from it could be from someone who doesnt know  someone who has a bad opinion of it  or even a complete pervert 
5,7,Mr. Garrison,wha why did you pan to me just now what the hell is that sposed to mean
5,7,Sharon,this whole mess started because we couldnt talk to our boy ourselves

5,13,Cartman,doctor can you tell me exactly how stem cells work
5,13,Cartman,not at all but go on 
5,13,Cartman,my god
5,13,Cartman,so then could stem cells be used on someone whose muscle tissue is wasting away in other words if a little boy was dying from a muscular disease the stem cells could become new muscle tissue
5,13,Cartman,well so then if the stem cells are placed nest to s shakeys pizza they would become another shakeys pizza and youd have your own shakeys pizza where you didnt have to charge yourself to eat
5,13,Cartman,hmmm
5,13,Cartman,looks like someone is gonna have to try and change the governments mind 
5,13,Cartman,theres a pretty brave kid fighting for his life in the hospital right now doctor im gonna get him some bigger boxing gloves
5,13,Cartman,oh doctor  thanks thanks 
5,13,Cartman,oh and doctor ah never mind

5,13,Kenny,stan
5,13,Kenny,the makeawish foundation
5,13,Kyle,neat huh kenny
5,13,Kenny,yes
5,13,Kenny,i guess the only thing i wish is to not die
5,13,Kyle,he said his wish is not to die 
5,13,Kenny,no fuckin madonna 
5,13,Kyle,he said madonna is an old anorexic whore who wore out her welcome years ago and that now she suddenly speaks with a british accent and she thinks she can play guitar and she should go fuck herself 
5,13,Chef,hello there children
5,13,Stan,hey chef
5,13,Chef,hows it goin
5,13,Stan,bad
5,13,Chef,yeah things have been better
5,13,Stan,why would god let kenny die chef why kennys my frfffriend why cant god take someone elses fffriend
5,13,Chef,stan sometimes god takes those closest to us because it makes him feel better about himself he is a very vengeful god stan hes all pissed off about something we did thousands of years ago he just cant get over it so he doesnt care who he takes children puppies it dont matter to him so long as it makes us sad do you understand
5,13,Stan,but then why does god give us anything to start with
5,13,Chef,well look at it this way if you want to make a baby cry first you give it a lollipop then you take it away if you never give it a lollipop to begin with then it would have nothin to cry about thats like god who gives us life and love and help just so that he can tear it all away and make us cry so he can drink the sweet milk of our tears you see its our tears stan that give god his great power 
5,13,Stan,i think i understand
5,13,Cartman,my name is eric cartman and i live in colorado my best friend in the whole world is kenny mccormick and he hes sick right now hes real sick hes only eight years old and his doctors dont think he has very long to live look i realize that using the tissue from aborted fetuses for research is a touchy subject but all i know is that if theres a chance a chance that stemcell research could save my best friends life well i guess i owe it to him to try and change your minds  i love kenny mccormick and  i want you to love him too  and i uh im not the best speaker in the world maybe i can put it best in the words of a timeless song it was the heat of the moment telling me what your heart meantthe heat of the moment shone in your eyesi never meant to be so bad to youone thing i said that i would never do
5,13,Cartman,and so you see now that the ban on stemcell research has been lifted we can sell your fetus to companies like alder labs
5,13,Cartman,look i can offer you seventyfive dollars for that fetus right now jill
5,13,Cartman,great just sign right here please  hi havin an abortion today  great  listen if youd like to sell your abortion for research im offering uh seventyfive dollars help you out a little bit with your medical bill in there  and you sign right here  uh excuse me maam can i interest you in selling your aborted fetus 
5,13,Cartman,oh im sorry to hear that because uh theres a little boy dying in a hospital right now who sure could use that baby more than you could the stem cells from your fetus could help save his life
5,13,Cartman,alright now kenny has a fighting chance
5,13,Stan,yeah im gonna see my friend because he needs me right now
5,13,Stan,hey kenny  oh no  no
5,13,Kyle,he just he just stopped breathing and it was over
5,13,Stan,but  i didnt get to see him hell i i didnt get to sssay goodbye  did he say anything before he went
5,13,Kyle,he just said wheres stan
5,13,Mr. Garrison,and so we will all miss kenny his playful laughter his innocent smile but we will never forget that it was because of brave kenny that stemcell research was allowed to continue
5,13,Stan,i let kenny down im his worst ffffriend 
5,13,Cartman,you guys come quick 
5,13,Kyle,what cartman
5,13,Cartman,its  why its a miracle you guys 
5,13,Stan,what cartman whats happened
5,13,Cartman,look  i put the stem cells from all the fetuses i had next to a shakeys and they are replicating a new shakeys  it worked 
5,13,Stan,this whole time you were just using kennys illness to lift the ban on stem cell research so you could sell your stupid fetuses
5,13,Cartman,stupid fetuses its my own shakeys
5,13,Kyle,i actually hugged you i held you in my arms and and cried with you
5,13,Cartman,i think i only need a hundred or so more aborted babies  and i can finish up the kitchen

6,1,Stan,then city wok could say their food makes them lose weight
6,1,Cartman,thats right stan  its a cash cow i tell you

6,6,Butters,prepare o little town uh prepare for the greatest supervillain youve ever seen professor chaos 
6,6,Butters,huuh okay mom  yes uh sleet sleep for now  tomorrow the chaos begins 
6,6,Cartman,all right we wanna thank everybody for coming this is a great turnout  uh as you know our friend kenny died a few months ago and we are still looking to fill the void with a new friend now youve all been selected as possible candidates but unfortunately there is only room for one of you so stan and kyle and i will be spending the next few days going out with each one of you and narrowing our choices down until we think weve found the perfect friend are there any questions
6,6,Cartman,clyde  okay now the first thing we have to do is cut the list down from twenty choices to ten and so today we will all be going to the amusement park together to see who we want to cut please keep in mind that this will all be videotaped so put on your best friend faces and may the best friend win oh and we will be needing a ten dollar per person entrance fee
6,6,Butters,i am professor chaos and now this puny world uh will bow down to me 
6,6,Stan,so today we went to the amusement park with all our possible friends  it was a really fun time we rode all the rides and everyone got along great
6,6,Cartman,i think the person that stood out most at the amusement park was jimmy 
6,6,Kyle,tweek now theres an interesting choice tweek has a lot of qualities that i look for in a friend
6,6,Cartman,yeah ive only seen that kid in class but he never does anything hes more like a prop 
6,6,Kyle,towelie is a tough choice because  even though i can see how always having a towel around can come in handy hes just always so high
6,6,Cartman,we decided to get some oneonone time with jimmy and ride the log ride  the great thing was that because jimmys crippled we got to go to the front of the line  that was definitely big points for jimmy you know but but then we got to the ride itself and
6,6,Cartman,oh really  thats gonna cost some points 
6,6,Kyle,but right now id say if were gonna have a retard for a friend i i have to pick timmy because timmy doesnt tell any jokes
6,6,Stan,one thing for sure picking our new friend isnt gonna be easy
6,6,Butters,kneel kneel before professor chaos 
6,6,Butters,ah the look on their faces when they got the wrong soup i love bringing chaos  and thats only the beginning

6,9,Kyle,yeah what if they had modified the roman coliseum every year it would just be another big douchey stadium now
6,9,Stan,we have to do something lets form a club
6,9,Cartman,yeah we can form a club that takes food stamps from poor people and then sells them back to the government for a profit
6,9,Stan,no fatass i mean a club to protect films from their directors so they cant be messed with
6,9,Kyle,yeah well be the save films from their own directors club
6,9,Cartman,tweek now goddamnit we picked you to be our new friend to replace kenny because we thought you were a team player

6,9,Cartman,yes we apologize but our friend tweek here didnt make enough of them
6,9,Stan,you mean you just came because you believe in our cause
6,9,Stan,aaaah  okay apparently theres been a bit of a misunderstanding this is a rally to save films from their directors 
6,9,Kyle,we believe that films are pieces of art that must be preserved from the perverse hands of their agent filmmakers
6,9,Stan,waitwaitwaitwait  dont you see whats happening out there the films you all grew up with that touched your lives and are part of your soul are now being updated and changed join us and we can be a group that makes a difference

6,9,Kyle,me
6,9,Kyle,alright fine  youre the spokesman cartman but youd better not screw it up
6,9,Cartman,what could possibly go wrong
6,9,Cartman,i believe that can best be answered by our official spokesman tweek 
6,9,Kyle,we believe that films have to be taken away from people like steven spielberg and george lucas because theyre insane
6,9,Cartman,dude thats steven spielberg and george lucas 
6,9,Kyle,ah i thought we were speaking for the children
6,9,Cartman,yeah were children
6,9,Stan,uhlook if the beatles went back and updated their white album every few years what would we have now
6,9,Cartman,yeah these guys are only motivated by money ted
6,9,Cartman,think about it spielberg jew lucas jew kyle jew coincidence
6,9,Kyle,dude dont you see that its not itd be like changing raiders of the lost ark
6,9,Kyle,no noo
6,9,Stan,members this is our darkest hour weve just learned that george lucas and steven spielberg now intend to update and change raiders of the lost ark  theres only one way we can stop this important and historical piece of art from being harmed mr secretary 
6,9,Cartman,thank you  our intelligence tells us that the original negative to raiders of the lost ark is currently somewhere in george lucass house we need to find and usurp that negative
6,9,Stan,that is our understanding
6,9,Kyle,nonono we need to do this first
6,9,Stan,its just that you know he killed twentythree babies
6,9,Cartman,he killed twentythree babies in selfdefense
6,9,Stan,alright alright but right now weve gotta focus on getting those original prints of raider
6,9,Stan,well it looks like were gonna have to do this ourselves
6,9,Kyle,were just gonna fly to california and break into george lucass house whats stressful about that
6,9,Cartman,okay tweek let me tell you something youve been our new friend now for two weeks okay and ive gotta be honest with you it isnt going well
6,9,Cartman,people arent that into you tweek they find you kind of annoying now i say youve got one last shot here and i dont want you to blow it okay does that help take the stress off
6,9,Stan,okay go 
6,9,Cartman,stop tweek this is not the time for faggocity 
6,9,Kyle,this looks like the right room
6,9,Stan,over here 
6,9,Kyle,thats it
6,9,Cartman,alriiight get it tweek
6,9,Cartman,get it you piece of crap before i grab your nutsack and twist it

6,9,Stan,so we have to warm his icy heart with a hot island song
6,9,Cartman,its a cool island song
6,9,Kyle,well then were gonna end up freezing his hellish heart with a cool island song
6,9,Cartman,oh do we wanna do that
6,9,Stan,those rams can do to us what they will mr lucas but well never stop trying to protect films 
6,9,Kyle,its not too late to do whats right give us the print theres still some good in you mr lucas we know there is 
6,9,Kyle,you yourself led the campaign against the colorization of films you understand why films shouldnt be changed
6,9,Stan,youre wrong mr lucas theyre not your movies theyre ours all of ours we paid to go see them and theyre just as much a part of our lives as they are of yours
6,9,Kyle,when an artist creates whatever they create belongs to society
6,9,Stan,give the print to us so that we can protect it from spielberg and anyone else who wants to alter it
6,9,Kyle,dont listen to him you still have a chance to preserve your film 
6,9,Kyle,what
6,9,Stan,fuck you steven spielberg come on you guys 
6,9,Cartman,wow

6,13,Randy,aalright now now listen kids theres some things we need to put into context for you you see a man puts his penis into a womans vagina for both love and pleasure but sometimes the woman lays on top of the man facing the other way so that they can put each others genitals in their mouths  uh this is called 69ing and its normal
6,13,Sharon,see boys a woman is sensitive in her vagina and it feels good to have a mans penis inside of it
6,13,Randy,thats right its something adults can do with really good friends in a comfortable setting
6,13,Randy,going number 1 or number 2 on your lover is something people might do but you must make sure your partner is okay with it before you start doing it
6,13,Stan,wow

6,14,Cartman,ey
6,14,Kyle,fat tits thats a good one

6,14,Stan,i guess
6,14,Sharon,go ahead and kill yourself stupid tarbreath
6,14,Mr. Garrison,okay children lets take our seats uh apparently none of you tried to get me fired yesterday so i guess were just gonna have to go on and learn more today  now who can tells me what happens to water when we heat it up in the bunsen burner
6,14,Butters,it evaporates
6,14,Mr. Garrison,good butters now if we take the glass tube of the bunsen burner we can also see how other things react  evaporation is an exothermic reaction so lets look at an endothermic one mr slave position 7 please  now im gonna put the glass tube under mr slaves tight ass  the heat from mr slaves ass will act as our new conductor of energy
6,14,Mr. Garrison,okay now butters could you bring over lemmiwinks for me please
6,14,Butters,sure 
6,14,Stan,oh no no no no no no

6,14,Chef,now why do you wanna go be intolerant of gay people children  i thought you knew better
6,14,Stan,well we didnt think we were but mr garrison has this new assistant and were really uncomfortable around him
6,14,Chef,children a lot of times the reason get uncomfortable around gay people is that they have some issues themselves you have to ask yourself what is it about their behavior that for some reason makes me uncomfortable
6,14,Kyle,well i guess its mostly the way mr garrison stuck a gerbil up mr slaves ass
6,14,Chef,right and you see children thats why you need to whoa what
6,14,Stan,are we homophobes now
6,14,Kyle,we dont wanna be gay bashers chef

6,14,Mr. Garrison,look this kind of behavior should not be acceptable from a teacher
6,14,Mr. Garrison,tolerant but not stupid look just because you have to tolerate something doesnt mean you have to approve of it if you had to like it itd be called the museum of acceptance  tolerate means youre just putting up with it you tolerate a crying child sitting next to you on the airplane or or you tolerate a bad cold it can still piss you off jesus tapdancing christ

6,14,Mr. Garrison,ogh okay so now can i please get fired and get my 25 million dollars

6,15,Stan,look i went and saw that john edward guy hes just a big douche
6,15,Kyle,hes not a douche he talked to my grandma
6,15,Stan,kyle you cant ruin your life based on what some douchey psychic said they all just use a technique called cold reading theyve used it for hundreds of years to make people believe them
6,15,Stan,no hes not
6,15,Stan,alright look ill show you i just need a volunteer how about you
6,15,Stan,okay im gonna pretend that a dead person is talking to me about you okay
6,15,Stan,okay watch kyle uh its an older man someone very close to you
6,15,Stan,does this month november hold a special significance
6,15,Stan,right because hes saying tell her happy birthday
6,15,Stan,see kyle i just started with something really vague i chose an older man because im betting that based on this womans age her father is most likely dead but if her father wasnt dead i could still say it was some other older man
6,15,Stan,i didnt i just asked her if november meant anything her father could have died in november or thanksgiving could have been really special for them but i go with the birthday and validate it now as if i knew by saying he wishes you a happy birthday
6,15,Stan,okay ill just use an old standard he saying the money stop worrying about the money
6,15,Stan,no it isnt when a father dies inheritance is usually an issue and money is something everyone worries about
6,15,Stan,what 
6,15,Stan,no wait
6,15,Chef,hi pop
6,15,Chef,these are my friends the cartmans 
6,15,Chef,hi momma 
6,15,Chef,mom this is my friend ms cartman
6,15,Chef,yeah pop this is eric
6,15,Cartman,right now
6,15,Cartman,whoa whoa watch it lady
6,15,Stan,okay listen to me listen very carefully  this is a trick that i am doing okay watch all im gonna do is say a name that im gonna pick at random okay  they want me to acknowledge pete or peter
6,15,Stan,no stop clapping all i did was pick a random name and wait for somebody in the audience to give a response now that i see that theres a lone woman crying my instinct tells me peter was her husband so i say peter was your husband
6,15,Stan,stop it i didnt do anything
6,15,Stan,i didnt start by saying peter is dead i started by saying they want me to acknowledge peter that could have meant peter was in the audience or that peter was somebodys friend or peter had died i couldnt be wrong see now i can look at this woman and see that shes fairly young so odds are her husband was fairly young when he died so i can say something like im getting that peters death was very untimely
6,15,Stan,okay lets back up  not literally
6,15,Cartman,ahh aahhhh 
6,15,Chef,the victim child
6,15,Chef,where were we gonna find a child to secrifice
6,15,Stan,here look kyle i found tons of testimonials on the internet saying that john edward has the entire studio wired to hear what people are talking about before the show and he pays actors to be plants in the audience
6,15,Kyle,youre just jealous hes a better psychic than you
6,15,Stan,fine i give up you wanna stay in new york then go ahead 
6,15,Stan,no i dont think either of us can 
6,15,Stan,im saying this to you john edward you are a liar you are a fake and you are the biggest douche ever
6,15,Stan,because the big questions in life are tough why are we here where are we from where are we going but if people believe in asshole douchey liars like you were never gonna find the real answer to those questions you arent just lying youre slowing down the progress of all mankind you douche
6,15,Stan,fine douche 
6,15,Chef,what do we do with it now
6,15,Cartman,hey ah i feel a lot better
6,15,Chef,eric youre okay 
6,15,Stan,no i dont wanna talk to you i wanna talk to the audience
6,15,Stan,you see i learned something today at first i thought you were all stupid listening to this douches advice but now i understand that youre all here because youre scared youre scared of death and he offers you some kind of understanding you all want to believe in it so much i know you do you find comfort in the thought that your loved ones are floating around trying to talk to you but think about it is that really what you want to just be floating around after you die having to talk to this asshole  we need to recognize this stuff for what it is magic tricks because whatevers really going on in life and in death is much more amazing than this douche 
6,15,Kyle,youre right stan my grandma isnt floating around judging me and watching what i do shes dead dead and gone forever
6,15,Stan,yeah
6,15,Stan,theres nothing special about you dude get over yourself
6,15,Stan,no it cant be

6,16,Kyle,what if the residue gets on our hands and it leads to harder drugs like those commercials say
6,16,Stan,you guys those commercials are just exaggerations
6,16,Kyle,where did you have sex with her
6,16,Stan,its just a stupid plant that makes you dumb touching it wont hurt you
6,16,Cartman,then you throw it away smartass 
6,16,Stan,fine i will  there see i touched marijuana im not a terrorist i didnt shoot anybody and i dont feel like doing more drugs now no big deal

6,16,Stan,our moms and dads lied to us about those future selves it was just a trick to get us to not wanna try drugs or alcohol
6,16,Cartman,goddamnit see this is exactly why i started this business if a parent cant respect their child than who can they respect huh
6,16,Butters,yeah
6,16,Cartman,listen parents understand one thing and thats consequences they need to see consequences from their actions or else theyll never learn what my company does is inflicts those consequences upon the parents in a very real and very direct way
6,16,Stan,how much is this going to cost us
6,16,Cartman,eighteen thousand dollars  how about just three hundred and eighty seven easy payments of a hundred ninety nine ninety five  how about five bucks
6,16,Randy,i think hes pretty scared alright
6,16,Sharon,its just a little weird having people lying to our boy like this
6,16,Sharon,well that makes sense
6,16,Randy,well i think when this is all over our son is gonna thank us
6,16,Cartman,okay butters lets start with you i think ive found a great way to get revenge on your parents just tell me if im going in the right direction here  what were going to do butters is were going to wait for your parents to leave the house and then smear all the walls with poop
6,16,Butters,hwuhh thatll make them awful sore
6,16,Cartman,now i want you to take a look at some of these poop swatches 
6,16,Butters,poop poop swatches
6,16,Cartman,poop comes in a lot of varieties butters i wanna find the perfect one tailored to your revenge on your parents
6,16,Butters,hey thats neato huh stan
6,16,Cartman,now personally i like the baby green  but i also think the classic brown would go nicely with your house
6,16,Butters,wow eh eh you sure are a pprofessional eric i dont know which swatch i like best
6,16,Cartman,well yyou know what we could do uh uh butters is go with the baby green in the living room and then maybe a classic brown or even a nutncorn crunch in your parents bedroom
6,16,Butters,well that sounds good
6,16,Cartman,okay well lets do that then that looks nice
6,16,Butters,hooray
6,16,Cartman,alright now stan for you ive put together a really nice design i feel your parents were a bit more cocky about lying to you and your revenge needs to reflect that so what i wanna to is put a note on your parents door telling them im the counselor from the school
6,16,Stan,yeah
6,16,Cartman,the note will inform them that a problem has come up and they need to see me rightaway back at my office
6,16,Stan,yeah
6,16,Cartman,your parents will drive all the way out to the school and discover that no meeting is actually taking place
6,16,Stan,yeah
6,16,Cartman,and while theyre gone were gonna smear all their walls with poop 
6,16,Butters,wow neato
6,16,Stan,thats not neato that sucks
6,16,Cartman,what
6,16,Stan,youre gonna smear butters parents walls with poop i thought his revenge was unique and customized
6,16,Cartman,poopsmearing is the hot ticket right now stan and have you seen the poop swatches
6,16,Stan,dude thats not extreme enough my parents arent gonna learn their lesson from having some crap smeared on their walls i want them to see what they did was wrong i want them to have them to admit that they lied to me
6,16,Cartman,okay okay fine i i just i just my first idea thats why we have these consultations  okay okay lemme lemme see here uh oh wait oh this is nice how about this uh well lure your parents out of the house and then well kill them uh well cut them up into little pieces and feed them to the dog
6,16,Stan,dude
6,16,Cartman,extreme enough for you hows wednesday
6,16,Stan,no thats too extreme
6,16,Cartman,well first its not extreme enough and then its too extreme where do you want it
6,16,Stan,just forget it cartman you dont know what youre doing 
6,16,Cartman,im a professional suh  dont worry about it butters youre gonna be a hundred percent satisfied
6,16,Stan,hey future self
6,16,Stan,you know that thing that i kept hidden in the hold in the wall for two years that ive never told anybody about  you know the thing that i take out of the shoebox every night before i go to sleep
6,16,Stan,you must know what im talking about
6,16,Sharon,uh stan  dont you think youre upsetting your future self a little
6,16,Randy,yeah stan dont be so hard on yourself
6,16,Stan,mom dad i dont think that guy is from the future 
6,16,Randy,oh you you dont
6,16,Stan,no  you know what i think i think this is all an elaborate hoax  and i think that whoever is doing it doesnt have very much respect for me  see the best way to try to motivate somebody is by being direct with them to be honest with them i think the whole future self thing is a lie and lies are never the right way to get your message across
6,16,Randy,well you know what i think stan
6,16,Stan,what
6,16,Randy,i think he is from the future
6,16,Sharon,yeah he must be  its like i just feel hes our son you know
6,16,Randy,right thats mothers intuition you cant argue with that no stan i think the only way youre gonna get of him is by staying clear of drugs and alcohol
6,16,Sharon,right 
6,16,Cartman,okay very nice very nice oh wait uh goddamnit felipe  the classic brown poop is supposed to go in the parents bedroom the living room is supposed to be all baby green poop
6,16,Cartman,la caca de moreno no es aquí aquí es verde señor es verde arriba arriba

6,16,Sharon,yes well eh you see son the time matrix pulled in more people from the future
6,16,Stan,aw stop it you guys i know all about motivation corp all ive been trying to get you guys to do is admit that you lied to me
6,16,Randy,oh well son weve just been trying to make sure you know how dangerous drugs like pot are
6,16,Stan,ive been told a lot of things about pot but ive come to find out a lot of those things arent true so i dont know what to believe
6,16,Randy,well stan the truth is marijuana probably isnt gonna make you kill people and it most likely isnt gonna fund terrorism but well son pot makes yuu feel fine with being bored and its when youre bored that you should be learning some new skill or discovering some new science or being creative if you smoke pot you may grow up to find out that you arent good at anything
6,16,Stan,i really really wish you just would have told me that from the beginning
6,16,Sharon,hes right if we use lies and exaggerations to keep kids off drugs then theyre never gonna believe anything we tell them
6,16,Randy,well theres only one person i can blame motivation corp
6,16,Randy,you really did a nice job eric 
6,16,Stan,yeah i gotta admit you really came through thank you i thought the hangover black went really nice in the lobby

7,4,Cartman,wow
7,4,Mr. Mackey,all right everyone thank you all for comin out to protest the war mkay 
7,4,Mr. Mackey,and now randy marsh is gonna sing a protest song he wrote about the war

7,4,Randy,i like to rock but i dont wanna rock iraq the only kind of rockin america should do is the kind that we can all dance to yeah
7,4,Randy,why are we fightin this wartheres a man in the office we didnt vote forthey didnt give me a choicewar is not my voice yeaaaaahhhh
7,4,Cartman,whoa how very very relevant
7,4,Mr. Mackey,and now wed like to bring out a couple of very special south park students who did a report on what the founding fathers would have to say about the war 
7,4,Randy,for you people who still think war is the answer perhaps you can listen to the voices  of the children 
7,4,Stan,uh we didnt do it
7,4,Mr. Mackey,what
7,4,Kyle,we didnt do our homework
7,4,Sharon,boys you were supposed to come out here and tell everyone about the founding fathers
7,4,Stan,well first we lost one study partner when cartman put himself in the hospital and then they took kenny away and then kyle forgot to set his clock ahead for dalight saving so we couldnt find anything in the history books about iraq and then
7,4,Mr. Mackey,the founding fathers would have protested like us
7,4,Cartman,oh its benjamin franklin its benjamin franklin its benjamin franklin
7,4,Cartman,wow i get it now i get it  whoa here it goes i wish i could go back to my time to my time to to my time
7,4,Cartman,wow
7,4,Cartman,everyone stop please 
7,4,Cartman,if you all dont mind i would like to do my report now i know what the founding fathers would say
7,4,Stan,he does 
7,4,Kyle,he does
7,4,Cartman,i learned somethin today this country was founded by some of the smartest thinkers the world has ever seen and they knew one thing that a truly great country can go to war and at the same time act like it doesnt want to  you people who are for the war you need the protesters because they make the country look like its made of sane caring individuals and you people who are antiwar you need these flagwavers because if our whole country was made up of nothing but soft pussy protesters wed get taken down in a second thats why the founding fathers decided we should have both its called having your cake and eating it too
7,4,Randy,hes right the strength of this country is the ability to do one thing and say another
7,4,Mr. Mackey,i guess we owe you an apology
7,4,Kyle,cartman cartman saved the day
7,4,Stan,cant be
7,4,Cartman,the founding fathers want you all to know that we can disagree all we want as long as we agree that america kicks ass
7,4,Randy,and im a little bit rocknrollah 
7,4,Randy,and me ill be the caring soul
7,4,Randy,come on up here everybody 
7,4,Mr. Mackey,and still tells the world that we dont

7,6,Kyle,awww shit
7,6,Stan,all right sir well please call us if you need anything 
7,6,Cartman,stupid assholes  how come nobody has a crime to solve
7,6,Kyle,yeah maybe starting a detective club isnt such a bright idea
7,6,Stan,its a great idea we just have to keep working at it 
7,6,Stan,hello maam were detectives with the south park crime unit do you have any crimes you need to be solved for a dollar
7,6,Kyle,really
7,6,Cartman,my god
7,6,Stan,have you reported this to any other authorities
7,6,Kyle,cool well see what we can find maam
7,6,Stan,were on the case
7,6,Cartman,what have you got marsh
7,6,Stan,detective mccormick found something interesting 
7,6,Cartman,jesus were too late
7,6,Kyle,i think we can piece this case together now
7,6,Kyle,well weve all talked it through and weve come up with a theory
7,6,Stan,you said you set the pie in the window sill where it must have sat for some time  but its sweet smell attracted the attention of somebody 
7,6,Kyle,your husband  he wanted that pie badly but he knew that he was not allowed to eat it yet
7,6,Cartman,slowly the rage built inside his mind  why wont she let me eat that pie why does she always stop me from doing what i wanna do his only solution became obvious kill her
7,6,Stan,his plan was to use a hammer
7,6,Cartman,bash bash bash your skull in causing instant death 
7,6,Stan,then to make it impossible for police to identify the body hed use a shovel to remove your head 
7,6,Kyle,then saw off the arms and legs 
7,6,Cartman,the torso he would dump into the lake 
7,6,Stan,the arms and legs he would dissolve with acid and lye in the bathtub 
7,6,Cartman,and then finally hed be able to eat that pie
7,6,Kyle,but before he could go through with this entire plan he discovered that the pie had already been eaten  by your dog 
7,6,Cartman,looks like the game is over old man 
7,6,Stan,just the news
7,6,Stan,hey you owe us a dollar lady
7,6,Stan,wow look you guys our first dollar 
7,6,Kyle,were in business

7,6,Cartman,dont worry maam well find your doll
7,6,Cartman,no sign of forced entry
7,6,Kyle,but the window isnt locked
7,6,Stan,right so its possible that the thief sat out in that tree  he would have watched sarah with the doll possibly while cutting the palms of his hands with a large knife  the pain gave him sick pleasure
7,6,Kyle,disposing of the doll wouldnt be easy he would have had to have brought a shovel to decapitate it
7,6,Cartman,were going to need semen samples from everything in this room

7,10,Cartman,ooooh isnt this great you guys being able to walk the streets now that old people are confined to their homes where they belong
7,10,Stan,uh grandpa i dont think you should be driving
7,10,Kyle,well look at it this way statistically speaking were safer inside a car with an old person driving than outside
7,10,Cartman,my god hes right  hail mary full of grace the lord is with thee even though i walk through the valley of death  guys i dont know if i ever told you this but well i love you guys  except for you kyle

7,10,Randy,were not treating you like children dad all right now i think you owe mr police officer an apology who needs to apologize hm  whos the sorrysorry
7,10,Randy,well fine i was gonna bail you out but maybe you can just sit here for a bit and think about what you did
7,10,Stan,whats that
7,10,Mr. Garrison,and so you see children genghis khan was a mongol not to be confused with a mongoloid like the actor nicholas cage okay now who can tell me in what  year the first film by a mongoloid  thats odd  those rotc guys are way off course 
7,10,Cartman,more old people
7,10,Stan,the american association of retired persons
7,10,Mr. Garrison,stay in your seats children ill be right back
7,10,Mr. Garrison,uh can i help you folks find something  oowww 
7,10,Cartman,old people gone mad
7,10,Randy,what the hell is going on
7,10,Randy,dad what are you doing
7,10,Randy,this is insane dad you all need to stop right now before more people get hurt
7,10,Stan,hey dad
7,10,Randy,stan boys youre safe
7,10,Stan,dad why is everyone letting old people do this why doesnt somebody stop them
7,10,Randy,theyve tried to stop them son but the seniors get up so early in the morning they get everything done before everyone else is even awake
7,10,Kyle,theyre saying something about taking over the entire country
7,10,Randy,yes and now seeing how early they get up i dont see how anyone can stop them wait a minute you boys you get up almost as early as they do you can fight them
7,10,Stan,no come on dad cant you guys do it
7,10,Randy,no son we like to sleep in
7,10,Randy,theyre coming get out of here before they see you run to the hills and find a way to fight them go  boys avenger me avenger me
7,10,Stan,all right check it out kenny did reconnaissance on the town the old people have blockades here  and here  the old ladies are keeping watch in towers around the perimeter and the leaders along with my grandpa are most likely in the mayors office
7,10,Cartman,so our only solution is to cut off their life force
7,10,Kyle,we cant fight them cartman
7,10,Cartman,no but we can sneak into town and shut down their food supply  here
7,10,Kyle,country kitchen buffet
7,10,Cartman,yeah you take out country kitchen buffet and old people wont know what to do
7,10,Kyle,thats a retarded idea cartman
7,10,Cartman,is it two years ago they closed the country kitchen buffet in steamboat springs and all the old people died of starvation in less than a week
7,10,Stan,yeah i remember hearing about that
7,10,Kyle,ech even if it could work how would we go about shutting it down
7,10,Cartman,i think i have a plan though well have to do it tonight  well start by sneaking into town cleverly disguised as black people  at 545 kenny and kyle split off and set a diversion on the east end of town  meanwhile stan and i sneak into the mayors office  and steal some of the explosives the old people have stashed nine oclock we rendezvous at the country kitchen buffet where we strap the explosives and the timer to kyles chest we say our tearful goodbyes to kyle and then we send him inside 
7,10,Cartman,yeah
7,10,Stan,all right
7,10,Kenny,woohoo
7,10,Cartman,aw yeah
7,10,Stan,we did it 
7,10,Stan,yeah or we just go to country kitchen buffet and lock it from the inside so the seniors cant get in
7,10,Cartman,well right or we could always do that
7,10,Randy,whoahohoooh what happened is it over
7,10,Randy,well i think he learned his lesson huh dont you feel silly now dad i think somebody owes us all an apology yes he does
7,10,Stan,oh stop it dad this is partly your fault
7,10,Randy,huh
7,10,Stan,look all grandpa wants is not to be talked to like a child i think half of what he was angry about wasnt what you were doing but how you were doing it
7,10,Stan,and grandpa you should be proud that you made it through life to be a senior but you should also realize that when youre behind the wheel youre a killing machine
7,10,Randy,well i think this has been a real learning experience for the marsh family people died but we all grew a bit lets just go home
7,10,Randy,thats our grandpa 
7,10,Stan,dude i hate my family 
7,11,Stan,dude i wonder where kyle is
7,11,Cartman,maybe he caught a disease and died thatd be so awesome

7,12,Stan,no it proves he did make it all up are you blind
7,12,Stan,no its a matter of logic if youre gonna say things that have been proven wrong like that the first man and woman lived in missouri and that native americans came from jerusalem then youd better have something to back it up all youve got are a bunch of stories about some asswipe who read plates nobody ever saw out of a hat and then couldnt do it again when the translatios were hidden
7,12,Randy,hey stan dont denounce our religion
7,12,Stan,i dont wanna be mormon dad

7,13,Cartman,heh okay okay  you know some people say theres no proof that secondhand smoke kills the tobacco companies say theres no proof that secondhand smoke kills ive just been diagnosed with terminal lung cancer i guess im the proof the next time you want to believe that secondhand smoke doesnt kill think about me because by the time you see this commercial ill be dead  dead
7,13,Cartman,uh what what does that mean ill be dead hey uh what what was that dead part

7,13,Stan,oh all right
7,13,Kyle,no what we really should do is go to our parents right now and take responsibility for smoking ourselves even if it means getting grounded
7,13,Stan,why
7,13,Kyle,because if we go to the tobacco company i know exactly whatll happen theyll take us in and then rob reiner will show up with all the townspeople holding torches or something and therell be a big showdown until we talk about what we learned and change everyones minds  this is all following a formula
7,13,Stan,so its either deal with all that or be grounded for three weeks

7,13,Stan,it wasnt the tobacco companies fault that we smoked it was our fault us we should all take personal responsibility instead of letting fat fascists like him tell us what to do
7,13,Mr. Mackey,youre right boys mkay

8,3,Kyle,oh okay but did god sent jesus to die or did jesus just get kind of screwed over
8,3,Kyle,well i have this friend see and this friend belongs to a certain chosen people of israel and it so happens that these chosen people killed your lord
8,3,Kyle,right but he cant live with the guilt anymore because even if jesus wasnt really the son of god he was still a nice guy and he didnt deserve what happened to him in mel gibsons movie i i cant sleep at night i mean my friend cant sleep at night
8,3,Kyle,but how can the jews make it better
8,3,Kyle,wait thats it atonement of course  i know what i have to do now thank you father 
8,3,Stan,mel gibson is fucking crazy dude  wait theres his wallet 
8,3,Stan,awww crap hes only got twenties you got two dollars kenny 
8,3,Stan,all right lets get the hell out of here 
8,3,Stan,aah run dude run
8,3,Cartman,one month ago today this amazing film opened in theaters and now we proud few gather here as a people brought together by its message  fellow fans of mel gibson our numbers have grown and now together we have the power to change the world  now i believe we should take to the streets and march in unwavering support of this important movie
8,3,Cartman,and as we march for the passion we should also voice our support so when i say es ist zeit für säuberung you all chant back wir müssen die juden ausrotten
8,3,Cartman,wir müssen die juden ausrotten 
8,3,Cartman,es ist zeit fër rache
8,3,Cartman,all right everyone forward march  es ist zeit für rache
8,3,Cartman,es ist zeit für rache
8,3,Cartman,nice
8,3,Kyle,thank you rabbi  in 1973 the united states officially issued an apology to the african american community for slavery in 1956 germany officially apologized for world war ii and the holocaust and now i believe in 2004 the jewish community needs to apologize for the death of jesus
8,3,Kyle,if we as a people choose not to believe that jesus is the son of god then we can still apologize for the brutal way in which he was killed and take our share of the responsibility for it
8,3,Kyle,i saw the passion
8,3,Cartman,es ist zeit für rache 
8,3,Cartman,es ist zeit für rache
8,3,Cartman,es ist zeit für rache
8,3,Stan,well it looks like with these bus tickets we spend about eighty seven dollars getting our money back from mel gibson  but i think its the principle of the thing that matters
8,3,Kenny,yeah i agree 
8,3,Stan,oh youve got to be shittin me 
8,3,Stan,goddamn that guys crazy  hey dude youve gotta speed up
8,3,Stan,mel gibson is chasing after us youve gotta go faster
8,3,Stan,im not playing games mel gibson is right behind you and hes gonna 
8,3,Stan,yeah i told you that
8,3,Stan,he wouldnt give us our money back for the passion so we kinda took it
8,3,Kyle,both you guys stop please youre gonna make people hate us more
8,3,Kyle,no no no dont become an angry mob  the last time we did that we killed jesus
8,3,Cartman,juden
8,3,Kyle,look out 
8,3,Cartman,mel gibson  oh mein savior mein führer youre actually here mr gibson i have assembled the masses we are ready to do thy bidding  have i been a good boy mr gibson
8,3,Kyle,dude whats wrong with him
8,3,Stan,hes kookoo dude hes absolutely out of his mind
8,3,Kyle,dude ive been freaked out this whole time because of that guys movie
8,3,Stan,its our eighteen dollars your movie sucked
8,3,Stan,no dude if you wanna be christian thats cool but you should follow what jesus taught instead of how he got killed focusing on how he got killed is what people did in the dark ages and it ends up with really bad results
8,3,Cartman,aw aw no come on people were so close to completing my final solution
8,3,Kyle,oh dude i feel so much better about being jewish now that i see that mel gibson is just a big wacko douche 
8,4,Cartman,dude these little remotecontrolled cars are kickass

8,6,Cartman,sure maybe mr jeffersons a little different but thats because he had to work all the time when he was young and missed out on his childhood whats wrong with wanting to have the innocence and beauty of a child
8,6,Kyle,all right lets just say all the bad things said about mr jefferson are lies lets say the police department does just go around spending their time framing people for crimes they didnt commit  lets say its all made up and mr jefferson is just a nice guy whos trying to be a child because he never got to have a childhood well thats fine except for that he has children now and when people have children they have to grow up
8,6,Kyle,all right things just might work out

8,7,Stan,well dude they are taking peoples jobs away
8,7,Randy,theyre only taking the small menial jobs that nobody else really wants to do
8,7,Stan,i wanted my job
8,7,Randy,hey stanley you need to understand something those people from the future have had a hard life where they come from is dirty and overpopulated and poor you cant even imagine the kind of depression they come from so for us who have everything sooo good to judge them is wrong do you understand next time you think about calling them goobacks you might just wanna stop for a second and think about how crappy the future really is
8,7,Sharon,thats right were not raising our son to be an ignorant timecist
8,7,Stan,timecist
8,7,Sharon,you know a racist but against people from the
8,7,Stan,people from the future right got it
8,7,Randy,all right good now lets all go eat some of mrs gruhds great future cooking
8,7,Kyle,what
8,7,Kyle,dude hold on this is bullcrap if they wanna live in our time then they should learn our language
8,7,Stan,thats right 
8,7,Kyle,aw dude 
8,7,Stan,can you speak in presentday english please
8,7,Stan,uh yeah i want a double cheeseburger and fries
8,7,Stan,no a double cheeseburger and fries
8,7,Stan,what
8,7,Cartman,we cant understand you asshole 
8,7,Stan,im trying to order a double cheeseburger
8,7,Stan,no its not a chicken sandwich  i want a goddamned cheeseburger and some goddamned fries you fucking goobacks
8,7,Randy,stan marsh
8,7,Stan,aw awwww
8,7,Stan,aw come on dad how come i have to go to work with you
8,7,Randy,because youre being grounded stanley now i dont wanna hear another word out of your intolerant mouth  you just sit right there stanley and you thnk about what youve done 
8,7,Randy,hey mr nelson
8,7,Randy,why this is my office
8,7,Randy,what
8,7,Randy,you cant be serious
8,7,Randy,oh my god they took my jarb
8,7,Stan,they took yer jarb
8,7,Randy,were doing the only thing we can do if our government is just gonna let anybody into our time who wants to come then we have to take matters into our own hands  were trying to turn everyone gay so that there are no future humans presentday america number one
8,7,Randy,all we can do is try harrison
8,7,Stan,i i think its wrong to call them goobacks because theyre no different from us  theyre just humans trying to make their lives better look it sucks that the immigrants time is so crappy but the cold hard truth is that if we let them all come back to our time then its just gonna make our time crappy too maybe the answer isnt trying to stop the future from happening but making the future better 
8,7,Stan,i mean maybe if we all commit right now to working toward a better future then then the future wont be so bad and these immigrants wont need to come back here looking for work
8,7,Randy,well what are we waiting for
8,7,Cartman,look its working 
8,7,Stan,were doing it
8,7,Stan,dude wait wait ho hold on wait a second  this is gay

8,8,Stan,this is bullcrap dude
8,8,Cartman,goddammit vegans piss me off now were gonna end up with a stupid eagle or a faggy bobcat as a mascot
8,8,Kyle,wait you guys i have an awesome idea we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet and instead write in giant douche
8,8,Cartman,yeheah
8,8,Kenny,yeah totally awesome
8,8,Cartman,yeh no no wait wait i got a better idea you guys what we should do is we should secretly go around and tell all the students we can to not check any of the mascots on this election sheet and instead write in turd sandwich

8,8,Sharon,what did you say
8,8,Randy,did you just say that voting is ridiculous
8,8,Stan,no i think voting is great but if i have to choose between a douche and a turd i just dont see the point

8,8,Randy,you dont care you really want a turd sandwich as your school mascot on your football helmets a turd
8,8,Sharon,well hold on randy i think a turd sandwich is a little better than them having a giant douche on their uniforms

9,2,Cartman,please i have to talk to you all right now
9,2,Cartman,mayor something very big is happening and if you all dont give me a moment of your time there may be no more south park to council over
9,2,Randy,what are you talking about
9,2,Cartman,im talking about the end of all life as we know it  for the past several days ive been noticing a steep rise in the number of hippies coming to town  at first i thought maybe it was just a coincidence  then i saw this  three new drum circles have sprouted up here here and here theyre all growing in diameter at a rate of two hippies per hour what this means is that the hippies are conglomerating theyre thriving if you will i think that theyre setting up for a  hippie music festival
9,2,Cartman,its its simple science look when hippies start to nest in a new area it draws other hippies in with the right weather conditions and topography it can lead to a music festival one that last for days even weeks reggae on the river woodstock burning man they will all pale in comparison to what were looking at now in my professional opinion i think were looking at a fullblown hippie jam festival the size of which weve never seen 
9,2,Cartman,i know hippies ive hated them all my life ive kept this town free of hippies on my own since i was five and a half but i cant contain them on my own anymore we have to do something fast
9,2,Mr. Mackey,uh eric were were talkin about potholes right now mkay
9,2,Cartman,its not potholes you need to worry about its potheads i know what these people are capable of 
9,2,Cartman,what are you doing  you have to listen to me you cant sweep this problem under the rug  the town is in serious danger

9,2,Randy,my god
9,2,Cartman,in less than three days all of south park will be completely consumed my only hope is to fight our way to the center of the crowd and reach the heart here  if we can reach the stage we can upload this slayer cd into their music system  hippies cant stand death metal if everything works they should disperse just before they consume us all
9,2,Cartman,we drill  ive designed a vehicle that can bore its way through even the densest hippie crowd they pilots inside will be safe from the pot smoke and the crappy music outside
9,2,Cartman,not just somebody i need a complete team to operate this vehicle along with me im gonna need a scientist an engineer and of course a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong
9,2,Randy,im the only scientist in town
9,2,Cartman,all right then we just need a black person who can sacrifice himself in case something goes wrong  lessee anyone would do anyone who meets the qualifications lets see  oh i know how about

9,8,Randy,my colleagues in the scientific community are still running tests but we believe it may happen the day after tomorrow 
9,8,Randy,with all due respect clichй dissenting republican the economy isnt going to matter the day after tomorrow 
9,8,Randy,oh my god thats today 
9,8,Randy,stan get in the car we have to evacuate

9,8,Stan,no i broke the fucking dam
9,8,Stan,i literally broke the dam
9,8,Stan,on a boat that wasnt mine
9,8,Stan,i kept it secret for two days
9,8,Stan,the boat caught on fire and it exploded
9,8,Stan,ohhh fuck it
9,9,Kyle,what are all you guys doing here
9,9,Stan,yeah us too
9,9,Cartman,ah gentlemen thank you for coming we dont have a lot of time so ill cut to the chase the girls at our school have been hiding something from us hiding something huge
9,9,Cartman,what if i were to tell you that the girls have a device which allows them to see into the future
9,9,Stan,what
9,9,Butters,how do you know
9,9,Kyle,the girls do not have a device that shows them the future cartman thats retarded
9,9,Cartman,thank you clyde uh im afraid its true  i secretly videotaped the girls in the playground yesterday using my wellington bear video camera  i caught the following images on tape i warn you this images maybe be too shocking for young children
9,9,Butters,okay im not lookin 
9,9,Cartman,video playback initialized 
9,9,Stan,oh my god how does it know the answer
9,9,Cartman,believe it the girls can ask any question they want and it gives the answer freeze image  gentlemen we have to get our hands on that device
9,9,Cartman,how is the incubation shield coming clyde
9,9,Cartman,good man any luck here
9,9,Kyle,the outside of the device seems to be covered in numerals inside are colors which must open up to some sort of temporal time warp
9,9,Cartman,good keep working we want to know all we can before we try to operate it  all right gentlemen our containment center for the time warp is nearly complete all thats left for us to do is get the device from the girls and bring it here
9,9,Cartman,dont be a fool craig do you really think the girls are just gonna hand that technology over
9,9,Stan,so what do you suggest
9,9,Cartman,heidi turner  is going to have a slumber party on thursday night theres no doubt in my mind the girls will be using the futuretelling device there if we can get somebody invited to that slumber party not only can we get a hold of the device but find out how to use it
9,9,Stan,yeah theres just one problem a boy cant go to a chicks slumber party
9,9,Cartman,no not a boy but a girl one of us is gonna have to go undercover show up in school tomorrow disguised as the new girl who just moved to town
9,9,Cartman,no not like juwanna mann kevin okay its way cooler than that
9,9,Stan,but if one of us pretends to be the new girl in class the girls will wonder where that boy went
9,9,Cartman,which is why we have to fake that boys death its simple spy stuff my friends take your top man fake his death then send him in disguised as the enemy
9,9,Kyle,thats a pretty solid idea but who
9,9,Butters,oh uh hi mom
9,9,Cartman,just keep stalling butters we dont have the dead pig quite ready yet 
9,9,Butters,naw geez now im gonna get grounded too
9,9,Cartman,okay its ready step down butters 
9,9,Cartman,okay one two

9,9,Butters,well im just a typical little girl i like dancin and ponies aand  getting my snootch pounded on friday night
9,9,Butters,oh
9,9,Cartman,dude they totally think hes a girl 
9,9,Butters,oh uhm you know girl places
9,9,Cartman,dude theyve bought it hook line and sinker  this is going swimmingly 
9,9,Stan,all right butters thats heidis house
9,9,Butters,i cant do it fellas i cant go into a girls slumber party what if they find out i aint a girl
9,9,Cartman,now butters we dont know exactly what is that girls do at their slumber parties but if they start you know lezzing out just roll with it
9,9,Butters,lezzing out whats lezzing out
9,9,Kyle,now look butters when the girls bring out the futuretelling device pay attention to how it works once you know how to operate it just grab it and get the hell out of there
9,9,Butters,then i can go home and tell my mommy and daddy im not really dead
9,9,Stan,yeah dude of course now go the partys already started
9,9,Cartman,remember butters you must get that futuretelling device from the girls at all costs and just roll with it if they start lezzing out
9,9,Butters,how about we read each others future
9,9,Butters,oh geez are we gonna start lezzing out 
9,9,Kyle,jesus what are they doing in there
9,9,Cartman,god only knows the horrors that go on in girls slumber parties lets just hope butters can survive it

9,9,Cartman,gentlemen this is a historic day for all of the boy and mankind in a few moments we will know the future 
9,9,Stan,hohold on on guys were not sure what this device is capable of maybe we should wait until weve had more time to study it
9,9,Cartman,no no we dont have time for that stan its time to ask questions
9,9,Cartman,because i do clyde
9,9,Cartman,im askin the first question lets just start with something simple will kyle die before hes twenty
9,9,Kyle,wait i dont wanna know that
9,9,Cartman,will you all shut up so i can do this
9,9,Kyle,i dont wanna know when im going to die fatass 
9,9,Stan,guys guys guys stop  look at what this thing is doing to us butters was trying to tell me something outside the house that this device is nothing but trouble i think i know what he meant now
9,9,Stan,we risked everything to get it from the girls how long before the girls attack us to get it back
9,9,Stan,and then what hide it forever from the government from the terrorists who want to use it for evil maybe maybe nobody is meant to have this kind of power
9,9,Cartman,are you guys nuts after everything weve gone through
9,9,Stan,we got it away from the girls thats what matters but now the right thing to do isnt using it ourselves then were no better than they are
9,9,Cartman,think of the power
9,9,Kyle,its too much power for anybody stans right it has to be destroyed
9,9,Cartman,are we sure about this well never know the future
9,9,Stan,nobody will thats the way its suppose to be hit it kenny

9,10,Stan,like i give a crap about what you think wendy 
9,11,Cartman,thank you mrs garrison  my speech is entitled ginger kids children with red hair light skin and freckles  weve all seen them  on the playground at the store walking on the streets  they creep us out and make us feel sick to our stomachs im talking of course about ginger kids  aww sick gross ginger kids are born with a disease which causes very light skin red hair and freckles  aw nasty yuck  this disease is called gingervitus and it occurs because ginger kids have no souls
9,11,Kyle,what
9,11,Cartman,kids who have gingervitus cannot be cured  ah sick  gross  yeck  because their skin is so light ginger kids must avoid the sun not unlike  vampires
9,11,Kyle,thats not true fatass i have red hair and i dont have to avoid the sun
9,11,Cartman,i was getting to that if you will let me  some people have red hair but not light skin and freckles these people are called daywalkers 
9,11,Butters,ho daywalkers
9,11,Kyle,this is all a bunch of crap
9,11,Cartman,mrs garrison im really havin a difficult time with all these interruptions
9,11,Kyle,its not a presentation its a hate speech people arent creeped out by gingers
9,11,Kyle,fine i will 
9,11,Cartman,fine in the meantime shut your goddamned daywalker mouth  lets see where was i oh yes like vampires the ginger gene is a curse  and unless we work to rid the earth of that curse the gingers could envelop our lives in blackness for all time it is time that we all admit to ourselves that gingers are vile and disgusting in conclusion i will leave you with this if you think that the ginger problem is not a serious one  think again 
9,11,Kyle,stupid supremacist asswipe
9,11,Stan,dude whats the big deal
9,11,Kyle,whats the big deal dont you understand what ignorant prejudice like that can lead to i have to disprove cartmans hateful rumors do you know any redhaired freckled kids
9,11,Stan,what about the foley family i think theyre all ginger
9,11,Kyle,hey wuh im giving a speech tomorrow about people with red hair and freckles can i ask you a few questions

9,11,Cartman,i want to thank everyone for showing up today ive called this meeting because i dont know about you but for one am sick and tired of being discriminated against just because we have red hair light skin and freckles were thought of as somehow less important and its bullcrap
9,11,Cartman,kids at school laugh at us doctors call us genetically inferior the world needs to know that we are people with feelings and our parents love us for who we are
9,11,Cartman,riiight exactly we cant let this go on any longer we should be proud of who we are think about all the great people in history who were ginger people like  like uh  liiike
9,11,Cartman,right ron howard and uh aaaaand
9,11,Cartman,right we already had him but right see ginger people go on to do amazing things in society we need to let everyone in this school know that we are not inferior that we are in fact beautiful totally awesome and supersmart its time for us to take back our pride
9,11,Cartman,red power 
9,11,Cartman,red power
9,11,Cartman,red power
9,11,Cartman,red power
9,11,Cartman,we gingers are proud people we are the noble descendants of great americans like ron howard and others we will not be discriminated against any longer for we are a great race
9,11,Cartman,red power
9,11,Cartman,red power
9,11,Kyle,i dont believe it
9,11,Cartman,red power
9,11,Stan,should we tell him the truth
9,11,Kyle,nah let him make a complete ass out of himself for a little while longer 
9,11,Cartman,red power
9,11,Cartman,better red than dead
9,11,Cartman,better red than dead
9,11,Cartman,thats right this is bullcrap we true gingers are furious that the role of annie is being minimalized
9,11,Cartman,the bitch isnt ginger shes just using makeup to look ginger and pretending to be ginger with makeup is the worst thing anybody can do
9,11,Cartman,there she is get her  die you stupid bitch
9,11,Cartman,thanks jody gingers how are we feelin  can i get a red power
9,11,Cartman,oh yeah that feels good doesnt it feels good to be proud of who you are now i dont think i need to tell you theres a lot of hate out there hate for awesome people like us and if theres one thing ive learned is that the only way to fight hate is with more hate we are not the freaks of society everyone else is
9,11,Cartman,gingers are the chosen people the chosen race and we must view the rest of the world as the lowlife darkskinned rats that they are 
9,11,Cartman,were fine thanks
9,11,Cartman,were fine
9,11,Cartman,youre welcome now leave us alone  my fellow gingers i envision a world in which there is no hate a world where everyone is ginger and so we must gather together every child who is not ginger and exterminate them
9,11,Cartman,now go go out into the night and take nonginger kids from their homes we will eradicate them all with cages and tortures and a pit of lava to thrown them all in now i am not gonna live my life as a goddamned minority are you with me
9,11,Kyle,dude were gonna go sneak into cartmans and change him back into a nonginger
9,11,Stan,huh why
9,11,Kyle,because now hes acting like gingers are awesome and all his friends are gingers when he wakes up tomorrow and realizes he isnt really ginger itll be hysterical
9,11,Kenny,hehe yeah hehe
9,11,Kyle,are you in
9,11,Stan, totally
9,11,Stan,you know cartman is an uncaring bigoted intolerant asshole but i have to admit i had my own prejudice about gingers i think we all need to realize that everyone is different in one way or another and we shouldnt be threatened by those differences i mean cartman had me kind of creeped out that gingers were gonna come get me in the night
9,11,Kenny,hehe yeah heh 
9,11,Kyle,oh hey there 
9,11,Stan,you guys need anything
